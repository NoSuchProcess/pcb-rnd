# when running pcb-rnd version 2.3.2 .. 3.0.0 from source, without system-wide
# librnd installation, this script must be sourced in the shell that will run
# pcb-rnd. E.g.:
#
#  cd src/
#  . ./pcb-rnd-src
#  ./pcb-rnd
#
# Note: this script needs to be sourced only once in a shell, as long as the
# shell is running it will remember the setting so pcb-rnd-src does not need
# to be invoked before each new ./pcb-rnd execution from the same shell.
