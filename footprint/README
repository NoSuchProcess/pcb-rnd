This directory hosts the pcb-rnd's new footprint library. To avoid
confusion with "newlib", which is in use in mainline, this one was called
pcblib - and got renamed to footprint/ for 3.0.0.

Some footprints are dynamically generated by scripts; they are
called parametric footprints and are in parametric/. Other footprints
are plain old data file footprints (static footpritns) in all the other
directories.
