pcb-rnd 1.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	[pcblib-param]
		-Fix: central bool handling (connector() etrunc), values: on/off, true/false, 1/0
		-Fix: typo in so() parameter descriptions
		-Fix: connector() typo in error()
		-Add: more elaborate help syntax: easier to read with scripts

	[fp2anim]
		-Fix: read multiline directives properly - a newline after each directive is still needed, tho
		-Fix: allow whitepsace between directive name and opening bracket
		-Fix: create all layers in advance - this fixes the case when the fp doesn't draw on some layers (the macro still exists)
		-Fix: rline() is extended by width/2 if there are no rounding; it seems this how pcb defines lines
		-Fix: leave extra margin in photo mode for the 3d edges
		-Add: support for old-style pad()
		-Add: support for Mark() (relocate the diamond)
		-Add: options to turn off the grid and annotation - useful for thumbnails

	[scconfig]
		-Fix: always have config.h, don't ifdef it
		-Fix: glib is a core dependency that should be added even if the gtk hid is not used
		-Fix: make clean removes pcb-rnd, not pcb (executable file name typo)
		-Add: make clean in util/
		-Add: options to disable gd and/or jpeg or png or gif
		-Add: be able to detect and configure lesstif 
		-Add: --disable-gtk and --disable-lesstif; --disable-xinerama and --disable-xrender for lesstif
		-Add: use detected -rdynamic so that plugins can link against the executable
		-Change: detect both gtk and lesstif as optional dependencies
		-Cleanup: generate hidlist.h from tmpasm instead of shell to remove shell dependency
		-Del: a bunch of obsolete #defines inherited from auto*

	[core]
		-Add: --gui explicitly selects a gui hid
		-Add: don't leave preferred order of GUIs to the chance, make it explicit


pcb-rnd 1.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	[core]
		-Fix: don't read beyond the common part of the struct in IsPointInPad (since it's called for lines too, and those have much less fields)
		-Fix: where stdarg is avaialble, also print messages to stderr - useful if things go wrong before a GUI is working

	[gtk]
		-Fix: don't crash but write error message and exit if gpcb-menu.res is empty 

	[square]
		-Fix: 90 deg rotation rotates shape style
		-Add: action.c and change.c code to get shaped vias
		-Fix: don't change pin shape for square and octagon in rotation

	[mincut]
		-Add: command line setting --enable-mincut (0 or 1) as mincut can be slow
		      it is a global disbale setting and make a local, per pcb setting
		      for enabling mincut; also add a per pcb setting/flag
		-Fix: disable debug draw by default
		-Fix: fall back to the old short warn method when mincut fails
		-Fix: avoid segfaults by detecting broken graph early
		-Workaround: if mincut sees a graph with multiple unconnected components, doesn't try to solve but falls back to randomly highlight something

	[intconn]
		-Workaround: find intconn pads only on the same layer

	[nonetlist]
		-Workaround: ignore nonetlist pads even if the flag is in the element name

	[scconfig]
		-Add: scconfig/ - switch over from autotools to scconfig

	[pcblib]
		-Cleanup: new, trimmed back pcblib/ with essential footprints only

 [pcblib-param]
		-Add: new parametric footprints - no more m4-hardwiring, use your
		      preferred language!
		-Add: acy(), alf(), rcy(), connector(), dip()
		-Add: so(), tssop(), msop(), ssop()

	[pcb-fp]
		-Add: central lib for footprint search and load in pcb and gsch2pcb

	[util]
		-Add: gsch2pcb fork to support [nonetlist] and [pcblib-param]

	[fp2anim]
		-Add: fp to animator script for fast preview

	[polygrid]
		-Add: ps output: draw grid in polys instead of fill (doesn't fully work)
		-Fix: set proper max value so the control is enabled


	[debian]
		-Update: build the package with scconfig and footprint changes
