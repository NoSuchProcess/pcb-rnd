		-Fix: typo in so() parameter descriptions

pcb-rnd 1.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	[core]
		-Fix: don't read beyond the common part of the struct in IsPointInPad (since it's called for lines too, and those have much less fields)
		-Fix: where stdarg is avaialble, also print messages to stderr - useful if things go wrong before a GUI is working

	[gtk]
		-Fix: don't crash but write error message and exit if gpcb-menu.res is empty 

	[square]
