pcb-rnd 1.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	[core]
		-Fix: don't read beyond the common part of the struct in IsPointInPad (since it's called for lines too, and those have much less fields)
		-Fix: where stdarg is avaialble, also print messages to stderr - useful if things go wrong before a GUI is working

	[gtk]
		-Fix: don't crash but write error message and exit if gpcb-menu.res is empty 

	[square]
		-Fix: 90 deg rotation rotates shape style
		-Add: action.c and change.c code to get shaped vias
		-Fix: don't change pin shape for square and octagon in rotation

	[mincut]
		-Add: command line setting --enable-mincut (0 or 1) as mincut can be slow
		      it is a global disbale setting and make a local, per pcb setting
		      for enabling mincut; also add a per pcb setting/flag
		-Fix: disable debug draw by default
		-Fix: fall back to the old short warn method when mincut fails
		-Fix: avoid segfaults by detecting broken graph early
		-Workaround: if mincut sees a graph with multiple unconnected components, doesn't try to solve but falls back to randomly highlight something

	[intconn]
		-Workaround: find intconn pads only on the same layer

	[nonetlist]
		-Workaround: ignore nonetlist pads even if the flag is in the element name

	[scconfig]
		-Add: scconfig/ - switch over from autotools to scconfig

	[pcblib]
		-Cleanup: new, trimmed back pcblib/ with essential footprints only

 [pcblib-param]
		-Add: new parametric footprints - no more m4-hardwiring, use your
		      preferred language!
		-Add: acy(), alf(), rcy(), connector(), dip()
		-Add: so(), tssop(), msop(), ssop()

	[pcb-fp]
		-Add: central lib for footprint search and load in pcb and gsch2pcb

	[util]
		-Add: gsch2pcb fork to support [nonetlist] and [pcblib-param]

	[fp2anim]
		-Add: fp to animator script for fast preview

	[polygrid]
		-Add: ps output: draw grid in polys instead of fill (doesn't fully work)
		-Fix: set proper max value so the control is enabled


	[debian]
		-Update: build the package with scconfig and footprint changes
