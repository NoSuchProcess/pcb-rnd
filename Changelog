pcb-rnd 3.1.1 (r37566)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	[asm]
		-Fix: ignore subcircuits of extended objects

	[cam]
		-Fix: doc_png exports bottom side with flip_y enabled for proper layer ordering
		-Add: doc_eps job to export colored top and bottom in eps for documentation purposes
		-Add: doc_ps job, similar to doc_png and doc_eps
		-Add: doc_ps draws copper faded and silk solid for readability
		-Add: cam job for Advanced Circuits, as reported by Bdale

	[ch_endpoint]
		-Fix: remove endpoint indications (on first subsequent redraw) when tool is switched to a non-indicating one

	[core]
		-Fix: pixmap transformation: avoid sign swap in rotation
		-Fix: scale pixmaps before rotation to keep their aspect if it's not 1.000
		-Fix: find.c vs. disjoint padstacks: set all-copper-conn'd for multi-copper padstacks only if the hole that connects them are plated
		-Fix: find.c vs. disjoint padstacks: don't require plated hole for the single-copper (smd) case
		-Fix: find.c: skip checking bloated up pstk against polygon for isc if clearance is larger than bloat and there's no thermal connecting them (works around line approximation false positive isc)
		-Fix: find.c: switch over from geometric rat-end connection find to (more precise) anchor based when rat anchors are avaliable; this means the rat line is connected only to the two objects it was mapped for; fixes the bug when two nointconn lines touch at endpoint from where a rat also starts and by geometry the rat shorts to two nointconn lines making an internal connection against the user's will
		-Fix: typo: check if rat rtree exists (not padstack rtree) before looking into the rat rtree
		-Fix: when removing a layer, all layers are renumbered; shift the thermal bits (indexed by layer index) in each padstack so thermals remain on the same layer after the re-indexing
		-Fix: allow idpath data address of buffer#n to end in /
		-Fix: idpath data address lookup: boundary check on the buffer array
		-Fix: pcb_idpath2obj_in() should be able to return object from buffer if the path refers to a buffer; provide an _only() variant that excludes the buffer
		-Fix: draw code used the wrong field for applying gui xform, causing conditional jump on uninitialized value
		-Fix: when converting string to thermal bits, accept NULL as empty string
		-Add: initialize new conf node rc.path.dotdir so users can refer to their own config easier
		-Add: hid_cam: support for global opt flip_x and flip_y so that bottom side layer order can be rendered correctly
		-Add: low level cam support for force_nonepty (creates output file even if layer group is empty, overriding the export plugins normal decision, in case the plugin cooperates)

	[dialogs]
		-Fix: reapply filter after a refresh to avoid gui inconsistency between the filter entry and the tree displayed
		-Fix: library window: refresh button shouldn't crash when filter entry is empty
		-Fix: library window on parametric edit: when the parametric footprint fails to produce a valid help text, don't override the filter with NULL string (causes segf)
		-Fix: typo in load file name filter name (should be rp, not rs)
		-Fix: Save() syntax should mention the extra, optional path argument where it is available
		-Add: library window: refine filter text tooltip: mention regex and case-insensitive
		-Add: padstack dialog instance tab displays logical layer id (for reference and to ease debugging)
		-Add: open dialog: file name filtering widget when opening a board

	[export_openscad]
		-Fix: don't hardwire pcb_ prefix in generated scad script, read it from a global var so later it can be changed
		-Add: export option 'prefix' to change module names to allow multiple exports to be used in a single large project
		-Add: do not hardwire board thickness 1.6mm but use the standard thickness query between top and bottom copper
		-Add: support for openscad-origin (object attribute) to set 0;0 of the board on the x;y plane

	[export_ps]
		-Fix: restore config after the export so that forced conf sets (like flips) are reverted
		-Add: set librnd's ps_faded before rendering a layer, depending on xform->layer_faded
		-Add: let cam override "layer group is empty" decision in both ps end eps
		-Add: --enable-flip in eps to respect flip_x and flip_y

	[export_stl]
		-Fix: ignore subcircuits of extended objects
		-Fix: initialize triangulation pool large enough to host cutout coords as well
		-Fix: use rtree search for cutout objects so that ones from subcircuits are picked up as well
		-Fix: remove temporary cutout polygons before uninitializing the cutout poly vector
		-Fix: separate export options into per format arrays so file names and other settings are remembered separately when exporting from the GUI

		-Fix: get the format enum initialized when called from the export() action
		-Add: make enum values (format template names) available for --help

	[cam]
		-Fix: pass on action design as the design-to-be-exported from the cam action (the code doesn't rely on PCB anymore)

	[core]
		-Del: remove 'reverted' parameter of pcb_board_replaced() - long unused, incompatible with the GUI moved out to librnd

		-Fix: inhibit menu merges while creating a new board so there's no invalid menu handling by a menu update between the old board already free'd and the new board not yet created
		-Fix: do notdraw pixmap 'X' on missing pxm render if target is an exporter, not a GUI (at the moment the default should be that we are not exporting pixmaps)
		-Change: switch over to librnd's font
		-Change: mark conf setting editor.beep_when_finished obsolete

	[export_svg]
		-Fix: don't use global design when it is available from argument; set expose context ->design before calling main expose

	[find.c]
		-Fix: gfx object should return explicit "no intersection" instead of assert so an accidental {c f} over a pixmap won't cause problems

	[footprint]
		-Fix: parametric common: do not generate square pad smaller than 4 nanometer to avoid polygon corner cases
		-Fix: parametric common: minimum thickness for smd pads so there's no invalid poly
		-Fix: common_subc: subc_proto_create_pad_rect() passed the wrong argument to paste and mask offset calculator

	[report]
		-Fix: allow net length (hotkey: {n l o}) searches originating from subc parts (e.g. a terminal) as a fallback

	[tests]
		-Fix: propedit test needs to use locally defined ASSERT(), can't depend on assert() being accessible (it's turned off in production)

	[tool_std]
		-Del: rat line draw doesn't beep when object clicked is not a terminal (this beep was really a no-op in many cases)
		-Fix: allow GFX (pixmap) objects to be locked/unlocked by the lock tool

	[util]
		-Fix: bxl2txt needs to have an extra -I calculated for librnd4
		-Fix: bxl2txt: use the CFLAGS as detected (-O3 and -DNDEBUG for production)
		-Del: deblist.sh - not used by anything anymore
		-Del: devhelper's 404.sh: it's enough to keep one copy in librnd
