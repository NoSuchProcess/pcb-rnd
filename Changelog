	[io_pcb]
		-Fix: recover from broken group string - create intern copper layer for any layer that is not referenced from the group string
		-Fix: do poly clipping only once during load - shorter load times
		-Fix: do not save duplicate element attributes (footprint, value and refdes - they are saved as property in this old format)
		-Fix: do not lose multiple special layers on load, even tho only the first one is placed in the right group
		-Del: pcb format documentation from the .y file - pcb-rnd should not attempt to document alien formats, we should leave this task to the maintainer of the format (geda/pcb in this case)
		-Add: warn the user when saving a NetListPatch - geda/pcb won't like it
		-Add: fix up broken (unlinked) outline layers after load (it's probably pstoedit that generates such files)

	[layer]
		-API CHANGE: creating a new bound layer gets a purpose string
		-Fix: whether the implicit outline layer needs to be drawn does not depend on how many outline objects got draw, but really depends on how many outline objects there were on those layers
		-Fix: when fixing up outline layer (e.g. after loading from old file formats), set the auto comb flag on the layers (to allow padstack use)
		-Fix: ask the hid whether plated and unplated slots should be drawn only if they exist
		-Fix: when creating real layers for bound layers, set new layer's object type to PCB_OBJ_LAYER
		-Fix: #tbs: do not let the user remove top/bottom silk groups (temporary workaround)
		-Del: PCB_LYT_ASSY, PCB_LYT_FAB, PCB_LYT_CSECT - use the purpose field instead
		-Del: PCB_LYT_UDRILL and PCB_LYT_PDRILL - use the purpose field instead
		-Del: PCB_LYT_OUTLINE - use BOUNDARY and purpose
		-Change: side-based silk+doc layer rendering to make sure about layer order; properly draw global doc layers (between intern and current-side doc layers)
		-Add: DOC and MECH layer types
		-Add: purpose field
		-Add: draw mech layers together with boundary layers, at the end
		-Add: when drawing boundaries and mech layers, pick best candidate for unplated and plated slots
		-Add: NewGroup() action for making it easy creating new layers from the menu (with context menu)
		-Add: DupGroup(): new action and menu item for duplicating a layer group

	[nelma]
		-Del: retire the plugin - upstream stopped maintenance and there was no user either (openems and other sims will take the role)

	[oldactions]
		-Del: Return() - something we never used

	[polygon]
		-Fix: rewrite the polygon offset code based on the colinear-corner-shift idea to avoid line-line intersections
		-Fix: when a layer is moved to a different group, reclip all polygons of the layer automatically
		-Change: expose the API of polygon offset low level - to be reused by padstacks
		-Add: polygon offset cache normal vector calculator
		-Add: draw_info bloat transformation works on polygons

	[propedit]
		-Fix: use the undoable text rotation change API
		-Del: text direction - use text rotation instead
		-Change: rename text rotation to direction to match the code and make room for real rotation
		-Add: code for handling text thickness and partial code for handling text rotation
		-Add: layer group purpose field
		-Add: missing code for removing attributes from board

	[pstk]
		-Fix: use ortho-grow for padstack shape offseting for more accurate results of derive/grow/shrink
		-Fix: do not crash if prototype is empty
		-Fix: missing 'else' made wireframe/thin draw poly shape filled
		-Fix: throw a loud error when a padstack with empty shape layer is broken up
		-Add: no-thermal clearance for hshadow should trace the hole or slot shape
		-Add: slot support: convert to pstk: accept one boundary or mech layer for slot
		-Add: hshadow support (special shape for clearance around the hole, without copper)
		-Add: low level pcb_pstk_shape_at_() that can be forced to return the shape even if thermal is NOSHAPE
		-Add: padstack draw respects the noshape thermal and inhibits drawing
		-Add: the thermal tool cycles through the no-shape bit now
		-Add: special treatment of off-board padstacks: do not clip or undo
		-Add: low level proto call for replacing the geometry in-place, without creating a new proto
		-Add: utility function to count prototype usage under data
		-Add: utility function for removing a padstack prototype

	[query]
		-Change: rename text rotation to text direction to make room for the real rot field
		-Cleanup: layer is a searchable object now, let the low level code search/list layers, but disable it from high level for now to keep compatibility
		-Add: support for text rot and thickness
		-Add: access layer purpose (group's purpose)

	[res/menu]
		-Fix: editing layer or layer group properties should unselect all so nothing else is edited
		-Del: mnemonics from the menu files (for HID API simplification)
		-Change: better key binding for the plugin management dialog: {p m p}
		-Add: integrity check in the maintenance menu
		-Add: change refdes submenu in subc context menu
		-Add: dedicated submenu for user scripts
		-Add: subc layer binding in the subc context popup menu

	[tests/rtt]
		-Fix: unify how pcb-rnd is executed; proper from-src-dir execution
		-Fix: use basename in ps/eps export to get reproducible output
		-Add: slot/mech example
		-Add: visual compare script, format-independent
		-Add: valgrind flags: detect memory leaks

	[rubberband_orig]
		-Fix: rat line connected to multiple terminals on the same coord would move the rat endpoint multiple times when the subc is moved
		-Update: moving a line with rubberband will remain connected to arcs by inserting a new route.
		-Update: Moving a line point that is connected to an arc will insert a new route to ensure that the arc remains connected.

	[scale]
		-Add: low level: text, arc, poly, line, padstack scaling
		-Add: pcb_data_t and buffer scaler functions
		-Add: ScaleBuffer() action

	[scconfig]
		-Fix: stroke: insert the internal conf file to DEPDEP so make dep runs even when stroke is disabled
		-Fix: cam, export_xy, fp_wget: explain enough of the internal conf so make dep works even if they are disabled
		-Fix: remove --with-intl - it can render pcb-rnd unusable while we don't really have support for non-english locales
		-Fix: detect popen(), missing popen is fatal (make the dependency explicit)
		-Change: centralize the plugin internal conf mechanism
		-Add: detect SIGPIPE and if present, set it to ignore to avoid external programs to exit pcb-rnd

	[script]
		-Add: fungw engine (glue code) for "scripting" in C
		-Add: Zoom(get) - useful for scripts
		-Add: action AddTimer() and a minimalistic timer implementation
		-Add: script data persistency: action for reloading and removing data
		-Add: dialog frame for a script dialog

	[subc]
		-Fix: do not change the subc pointer when moving to other side, rather do it in-place so pointers are not messed up (as reported by celem with autoplace)
		-Fix: preview displays terminal labels when enabled
		-Fix: when drawing preview do not draw the label of non-owned terminals
		-Fix: memory leak on subc-in-buffer breakup
		-Fix: subc dup needs to set layer struct type to PCB_OBJ_LAYER else the object is broken
		-Fix: do not double-unreg objects on subc destroy (caused asserts on undo)
		-Fix: display subc ID (red subc marking overlay) even if refdes is NULL - what we display is configurable and may differ from the refdes
		-Fix: side flip: put only the subc flip on the undo list, not each subc part's flip, to avoid double-flip attempt on undo

	[text]
		-Add: text string render: use transformation matrix instead of manual transformation calculations (preparing for arbitrary angle rotation)
		-Add: buffer free rotation: also rotate text
		-Add: user selectable text thickness
		-Change: io_lihata saves only rot, not direction from v6
