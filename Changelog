pcb-rnd 3.1.3 (r38476)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	[backann]
		-Fix: rats patch "already done" check: when accepting component add/del, consider the input netlist, not the edited netlist (the edited netlist will always have the modifiaction, independently of whether it's been annotated back to the schematics)

	[core]
		-Fix: typos in Net() help
		-Fix: when generating file name for saving rats patch, remove the now default .rp suffix before appending .bap
		-Fix: rats patch fwd annot verify: if a terminal is not on a net the call may return -1 (e.g. the net is missing) - accept thta as connection broken
		-Fix: rats patch: back annotation on subc del: check connectivity before connections are removed, else the actual comp del line will always be missing
		-Fix: separate netlist change event and netlist import event; clean up netlist patch list only after an import so back annotation entries are not lost accidentally (because they are already done on the board) without a forward annotation

		-Fix: do not consider aux layer when sizing subcircuit bbox
		-Cleanup: rename PCB_RPE_ATTR_CHG to PCB_RPE_COMP_ATTR_CHG as it deals with components only and there would be another for nets

	[lib_bom]
		-Fix: don't crash if sort_id renters to NULL string

	[lib_polyhelp]

pcb-rnd 3.1.2 (r38167)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	[acompnet]
		-Cleanup: replace compat rtree with native

	[autoplace]
		-Cleanup: replace compat rtree with native

	[autoroute]
		-Cleanup: replace compat rtree with native
		-Cleanup: remove inline, use portable RND_INLINE instead

	[build]
		-Add: ./configure --enable-polybool and --disable-polybool (default for now) to allow testing the new poly lib later on

	[ch_editpoint]
		-Cleanup: remove rtree2_compat.h dependency

	[ch_endpoint]
		-Cleanup: replace compat rtree with native

	[ch_onpoint]
		-Cleanup: replace compat rtree with native

	[core]
		-Fix: poly as-drawn frame annotation option also draws cutout contours
		-Fix: allow padstack convert from selected work in footprint edit mode
		-Fix: pcb_flag_uninit() should clear all fields (flag bits), not just the unknown-flags part
		-Fix: do not uninit flags while gui-erasing objects
		-Fix: no-effect poly clearance change operation wrarning message doesn't refer to obsolete MinClearGap() but offers modern alternatives
		-Fix: verify number of points in a simplepoly when drawing/decomposing font; skip and warn if there are too many points
		-Fix: font unlink: when the default (system) font is unlinked, cheat: make a copy and return that; this is required for the font editor because the board struct hosting the default font is soon to be free()'d
		-Fix: pstk thin draw: don't draw mech layer twice because it will make the object inivisible in xor-draw
		-Fix: remove padstack mirror optimization: there are cases when ps->y is 0 but we still need to change the coords
		-Fix: revert should do the same PCB drawing area bbox tuning that normal load does, when pcb is a footprint; this fixes the problem of not updating drawing area of growing footprint on reload-on-change (which is really a revert)
		-Fix: when subc is moved to buffer (most notably to removelist), rebind subc layers to the buffer after all the objects have been moved; without this, free'ing the subc (e.g. clearing the undo list which clears the removelist which frees all objects there) would leave ghost objects on the rtrees because at subc free the rtree is NULL so child objects are not removed from the rtree but those child objects are freed
		-Cleanup: rename pcb_flag_erase() to pcb_flag_uninit(), as "erase" is used in the gui redraw sense; the confusing terminology already caused the call to be in the wrong place for all objects
		-Cleanup: remove inline, use portable RND_INLINE instead
		-Cleanup: centralzie flag uninit on object free, into obj_common
		-Cleanup: remove old rtree compat, use native rtree instead
		-Cleanup: remove unused/unimplemented function proto (pstk clear draw)
		-Add: more sophisticated thindraw shape selection for drawing from buffer: pick top copper or bottom copper first and fall back to first shape only if those are not found; this avoids picking the mech shape for the main contour

	[dialogs]
		-Cleanup: replace compat rtree dir consts with native
		-Fix: don't crash when help text is NULL (not available) for a parametric library entry

	[export_stl]
		-Fix: switch over to generate all cutouts as an rnd_polyarea_t so that overlapping cutouts wouldn't cause broken export anymore
		-Cleanup: remove rtree2_compat.h dependency

	[export_xy]
		-Update: export_xy doesn't depend on export_bom anymore
		-Add: skip_if_nonempty template, to control which subcircuits to skip
		-Add: default templates: skip subcircuits that have the dnp attribute set

	[exto_std]
		-Cleanup: replace compat rtree entry with native

	[fontmode]

		-Add: topoly_cutout: include mech layer lines and arcs with their true shape so that slots work as expected

	[libcdtr]
		-Fix: there is no local genvector in pcb-rnd's src-3rd, use librnd's
		-Cleanup: remove inline, use portable RND_INLINE instead

	[millpath]
		-Cleanup: remove rtree compat dependency from toolpath calculation

	[oldactions]
		-Del: MinClearGap() action implementation
		-Add: MinClearGap() also suggests using polygon side clearance

	[polycombine]

	[core]
		-Fix: pixmap transformation: avoid sign swap in rotation
		-Fix: scale pixmaps before rotation to keep their aspect if it's not 1.000
		-Fix: find.c vs. disjoint padstacks: set all-copper-conn'd for multi-copper padstacks only if the hole that connects them are plated
		-Fix: find.c vs. disjoint padstacks: don't require plated hole for the single-copper (smd) case
		-Fix: find.c: skip checking bloated up pstk against polygon for isc if clearance is larger than bloat and there's no thermal connecting them (works around line approximation false positive isc)
		-Fix: find.c: switch over from geometric rat-end connection find to (more precise) anchor based when rat anchors are avaliable; this means the rat line is connected only to the two objects it was mapped for; fixes the bug when two nointconn lines touch at endpoint from where a rat also starts and by geometry the rat shorts to two nointconn lines making an internal connection against the user's will
		-Fix: typo: check if rat rtree exists (not padstack rtree) before looking into the rat rtree
		-Fix: when removing a layer, all layers are renumbered; shift the thermal bits (indexed by layer index) in each padstack so thermals remain on the same layer after the re-indexing
		-Fix: allow idpath data address of buffer#n to end in /
		-Fix: idpath data address lookup: boundary check on the buffer array
		-Fix: pcb_idpath2obj_in() should be able to return object from buffer if the path refers to a buffer; provide an _only() variant that excludes the buffer
		-Fix: draw code used the wrong field for applying gui xform, causing conditional jump on uninitialized value
		-Fix: when converting string to thermal bits, accept NULL as empty string
		-Add: initialize new conf node rc.path.dotdir so users can refer to their own config easier
		-Add: hid_cam: support for global opt flip_x and flip_y so that bottom side layer order can be rendered correctly
		-Add: low level cam support for force_nonepty (creates output file even if layer group is empty, overriding the export plugins normal decision, in case the plugin cooperates)

	[dialogs]
		-Fix: reapply filter after a refresh to avoid gui inconsistency between the filter entry and the tree displayed
		-Fix: library window: refresh button shouldn't crash when filter entry is empty

		-Fix: typo in load file name filter name (should be rp, not rs)
		-Fix: Save() syntax should mention the extra, optional path argument where it is available
		-Add: library window: refine filter text tooltip: mention regex and case-insensitive

		-Add: export option 'prefix' to change module names to allow multiple exports to be used in a single large project
		-Add: do not hardwire board thickness 1.6mm but use the standard thickness query between top and bottom copper
		-Add: support for openscad-origin (object attribute) to set 0;0 of the board on the x;y plane

	[export_ps]
		-Fix: restore config after the export so that forced conf sets (like flips) are reverted
		-Add: set librnd's ps_faded before rendering a layer, depending on xform->layer_faded

	[find.c]
		-Fix: gfx object should return explicit "no intersection" instead of assert so an accidental {c f} over a pixmap won't cause problems

	[footprint]
		-Fix: parametric common: do not generate square pad smaller than 4 nanometer to avoid polygon corner cases
		-Fix: parametric common: minimum thickness for smd pads so there's no invalid poly
		-Fix: common_subc: subc_proto_create_pad_rect() passed the wrong argument to paste and mask offset calculator
		-Fix: common_subc: subc_proto_create_pad_rect() called the wrong function for mask offset calculation (so it used paste defaults when mask was not specified)
		-Fix: common_subc: if paste/mask ratio is empty string, don't use it as a value but fall back on defaults

	[gsch2pcb-rnd]
		-Add: set up exec prefix

	[import_sch2]
		-Fix: don't crash in path resolver when there's no design path

		-Update: follow librnd4 API changes

	[millpath]
		-Fix: don't call text object decompose with NULL transformation in toolpath calculation, that'd lead to a segfault

	[oldaction]
		-Del: Bell() doesn't beep but throws an error

	[query]
		-Fix: net_len shouldn't crash on boards without any padstack (don't search NULL padstack tree)

	[report]
		-Fix: allow net length (hotkey: {n l o}) searches originating from subc parts (e.g. a terminal) as a fallback

	[tests]
		-Fix: propedit test needs to use locally defined ASSERT(), can't depend on assert() being accessible (it's turned off in production)

	[tool_std]
		-Del: rat line draw doesn't beep when object clicked is not a terminal (this beep was really a no-op in many cases)
		-Fix: allow GFX (pixmap) objects to be locked/unlocked by the lock tool

	[util]
		-Fix: bxl2txt needs to have an extra -I calculated for librnd4
		-Fix: bxl2txt: use the CFLAGS as detected (-O3 and -DNDEBUG for production)
		-Del: deblist.sh - not used by anything anymore
		-Del: devhelper's 404.sh: it's enough to keep one copy in librnd
		-Del: chglog scripts - use the one in librnd
		-Del: include, comment and copyright source crawler scripts - use the one in librnd
		-Del: rename scripts - use the ones in librnd
		-Del: "TODO grep" scripts - use the one in librnd
		-Del: local implementation of awk_on_formats - use librnd's
		-Move: html dialogs generator from doc to util to be shared with other apps later
		-Cleanup: list_dialogs doesn't get dialogs exrta from a file but from a shell var to make the system more modular and easier to reuse
