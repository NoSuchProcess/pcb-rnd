- ascii read, to test:
	- thermal conn (net based poly conns; altium testing engaged)
	- standard text test
	- slot (TODO)
	- bbvia (TODO)
	- viatenting (TODO)
	- multiline text: only from version 15.1
	- text-on-all-layers (4 layer board); also in footprint?

- ascii code:
	- support text height

- bin:
	- 10/15 text width test: layer 35 seems to be top paste, not top overlay

- conclusions on ascii read:
	- plane layers: can't host wires but can be split
	- mech layers: all the same; can be marked to be copied on all gerber files
