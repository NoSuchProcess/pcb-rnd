$class feature
$short netlist based dispenser
$long Improve the initial dispersion of subcircuits by choosing an order based on the netlist, rather than the arbitrary subcircuit order.  This isn't the same as a global autoplace, it's more of a linear autoplace.  It might make some useful local groupings.  For example, you should not have to chase all over the board to find the resistor that goes with a given LED.
