The plugin is disabled by default for now. This lets you work on it without
having to worry whether you break other people's compilation. You need to
enable it in your compilation, tho, when running configure:

./configure --buildin-io_kicad_legacy

Then run make (maybe only in src/)

After making modifications to the plugin code, it's enough to run make in
the plugin dir - as the module is a buildin, it will recompile pcb-rnd.

Run pcb-rnd from the src/ directory (cd there, it won't find its
files otherwise).

How to run the plugin (GUI version):
1. run pcb-rnd (from src/)
2. load a pcb 
3. open the command prompt (press ':')
4. type: SaveTo(PasteBuffer, foobar.mod, kicadl)

Now, the gtk dialog "Buffer: save buffer elements to file" allows kicad legacy format to be selected.

Arc and Circle support has been implemented but not fully tested.

This will save the current PasteBuffer contents to foobar.mod using io_kicad_legacy format.

Once layout export has been implemented, the following will be possible:
 
How to run the plugin (CLI version):

echo "SaveTo(LayoutAs, foobar.brd, kicadl)" | ./pcb-rnd  --gui batch my.pcb

(This loads my.pcb and saves it to foobar.brd and then exits)

[io_kicad_legacy] to make my job easier when generating Changelog.
