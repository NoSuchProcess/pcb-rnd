The plugin is disabled by default for now. This lets you work on it without
having to worry whether you break other people's compilation. You need to
enable it in your compilation, tho, when running configure:

./configure --buildin-io_kicad_legacy

Then run make (maybe only in src/)

After making modifications to the plugin code, it's enough to run make in
the plugin dir - as the module is a buildin, it will recompile pcb-rnd.

Run pcb-rnd from the src/ directory (cd there, it won't find its
files otherwise).

TODO: how to run

SVN: when commiting, please prefix all your commit message lines with string
[io_kicad_legacy] to make my job easier when generating Changelog.
