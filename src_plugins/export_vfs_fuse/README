1. Mounting a board

  mkdir /tmp/mntpt
  pcb-rnd -x vfs_fuse board.lht /tmp/mntpt

This will start a pcb-rnd process in the background. The proces will load
board.lht, just like if it was a normal GUI or CLI user session, until the
unmount.

Make sure /dev/fuse has the right permissions and your user has write access
to it. A typical setup is:
 - /dev/fuse having group +rw with group owner set to 'fuse'
 - the user added in the 'fuse' group

2. Unmounting a board

  fusermount -u /tmp/mntpt

This is when the board is saved if there was any change (write) while it
was mounted.
