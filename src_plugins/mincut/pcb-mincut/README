This mini-project demonstrates a minimal cut implementation tailored
to solve pcb-rnd "how to highlight shorts" problem.

It should compile out of the box on GNU/Linux using make. Running
a test case:

./main < test_cases/H3.in

If graphviz is installed, input graphs are drawn. Changing the
#defines in solve.c causes more debug messages printed and/or
debug graphs drawn.

The solver is portable as it is part of pcb-rnd. The stand-alone testbench is
not that portable. The production code is solve.[ch], the rest is for
the testbench.
