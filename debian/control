Package: pcb-rnd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, pcb-rnd-core
Description: printed circuit board (pcb) design program - meta-package
 pcb-rnd is an interactive printed circuit board editor for the X11 window 
 system. pcb-rnd includes a rats nest feature, design rule checking, and can 
 provide industry standard RS-274-X (Gerber), NC drill, and centroid data 
 (X-Y data) output for use in the board fabrication and assembly process. 
 .
 pcb-rnd is load/save compatible with geda/PCB and kicad and offers various
 auxiliary import/export formats.
