Description: printed circuit board (pcb) design program - meta-package
 PCB is an interactive printed circuit board editor for the X11 window 
 system. PCB includes a rats nest feature, design rule checking, and can 
 provide industry standard RS-274-X (Gerber), NC drill, and centroid data 
 (X-Y data) output for use in the board fabrication and assembly process. 
 PCB offers high end features such as an autorouter and trace optimizer 
 which can tremendously reduce layout time.
