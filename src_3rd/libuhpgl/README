The micro HP-GL library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libuhpgl is a small, portable (C89) library for parsing and generating
HP-GL data. It is designed for use as a converter in an application that
has its own 2d object model.

To accomodate to the object model of the application, the lib offers different
options for the drawing primitives, e.g. the application may chose whether to
support filled polygons or vurves (arcs, circles). The lib loads a sequence
of HP-GL instructions, builds a complex object (such as a polygon) in memory
and passes it to the application when all details of the object is already
known.
