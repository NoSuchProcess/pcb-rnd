_styleguide notes:_
urls all lowercased (eg. GTK becomes gtk)
pronouns: write to avoid pronouns, use user/developer, use she
organization:  hierarchial with lots of links for people who have tunneled deep?
naviagation: don't add navigation in page, rely on browser navs
html strict:  use standard html 1.0 
css:  use css for looks without content modification 
assets: generate assets (use dot, etc), assume make and same system is able to build pcb-rnd
tables: use zebra styling for ease of reading 
deps/requirements for pcb-rnd itself (we need an appendix table to live createthe actions list)
naming sections: despite lowercasing urls, keep naming concise so links have names that lead to sections with same names
