<H1> pcb-rnd - license </H1>
Pcb-rnd is a Free Software, Open source, under the terms of GPL version 2.
<p>
Pcb-rnd started as a fork of gEDA/PCB thus inherited its GPL2+ license.
See file <a href="http://igor2.repo.hu/cgi-bin/minisvn.cgi?cmd=cat&amp;repo=pcb-rnd&amp;path=trunk/COPYING">
trunk/COPYING</a> for more details on the license terms. Pcb-rnd
incorporates a few mini-libs with various, GPL-compatible licenses, mostly
BSD, MIT and public domain - the official Debian package has a great index of these.
<p>
<b>For users</b>: the resulting software is distributable under the GNU GPL version 2
(or later versions), the usual GPL terms and conditions apply.
<p>
<b>Contribution:</b> by contributing, you agree to submit patches that are conforming
to the license terms (e.g. don't copy random code from other projects). We
are keeping track of copyright: each contributor holds the copyright for and
is responsible for their part. Contributors agree to license their contribution
under the same term as the subproject they are adding to, which is typically
GPL2+ for core and plugins and utilities.
<p>
<b>Re-licensing under different conditions:</b> pcb-rnd's GPL2+ allows the user
to upgrade to GPL3 or later versions of the GPL (as long as new versions
don't contradict with the license of the mini-libs). It is not possible to
change pcb-rnd's license to anything else unless all past developers agree
(but there's not even a index of all the names!). It is possible to request
relicensing of the files that are brand new in pcb-rnd (they are all marked
in the copyright banner on the top of the file) - this requires the agreement
of all copyright holders listed in the file, and wouldn't affect other files.
Same rules apply for mini-libs.
