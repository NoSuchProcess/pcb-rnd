How to document actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Detailed action doc lives in trunk/doc/user/09_appendix/action_src in
almost-html files. There is no html header and the standard tags in use
are restricted to: b, i, p, pre, ul, li, table, tr, td.

There are a few extra, non-standard tags:

- <arg> argname </arg> names an argument of the current action
- <act> actname </act> links to another action; actname is all lowercase

The name of the file should be actname.html.

Documentation policy:

	- do not document the trivial - do not write alibi docs. We do not want
	  action doc to just repeat the syntax description. Please explore
	  what the action does, all aspects, all use cases; see if the syntax
	  help string already covers everything and the action is trivial to use;
	  if so, the action does not need any more documentation

	- after creating the html doc, please add a
	  /* DOC: actname.html */
	  comment above the action function in the source code

	- the doc is high level in the sense that it should tell the basic ideas
	  behind the action, how to use it, what it is for

	- it should not tell much about what bigger scheme it fits in (that's
	  even higher level, plugin doc; but should cross link relevant sibling
	  actions)

	- it should not repeat low level info (e.g. enumerate possible arguments
	  from the syntax string) if no extra info is added

	- do not do custom styling, the doc format is unified
