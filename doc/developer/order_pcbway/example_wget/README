This is the old API for quotes, not used at the moment.

The old API could take shipping address and give quotes for different
options but wanted to _download_ gerbers from an URL and pcb-rnd was not
going to run a web server.

The new API takes a http post upload of parameters and gerbers but does
not provide quotes (and does not handle shipping).
