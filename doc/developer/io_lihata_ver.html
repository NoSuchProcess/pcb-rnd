<H1> pcb-rnd - io_lihata versions </H1>
<p>
History of io_lihata, per format version.

<H2> lihata board </H2>
	<H3> v1 </H3>
	<p id="v1">
	Feature-compatible with the gEDA/PCB file format, plus allows multiple
	fonts. Same assumptions on layers: last two must be the silk layers.

	<H3> v2 </H3>
	<p id="v2">
	Introduce the layer stack subtree and remove layer assumptions. Save
	the combining field of layers.

	<H3> v3 </H3>
	<p id="v3">
	New global object subtree: subcircuit. Global object element has been removed.
	<p>
	Intconn is not a flag, but a pin/pad/terminal attribute.

	<H3> v4 </H3>
	<p id="v4">
	New subtree under data: padstack_prototypes, for storing padstack prototypes.
	ID is the place of the padstack within the list.
	<p>
	New object type under : ha:padstack_ref.id.

	<H3> v5 </H3>
	<p id="v5">
	Removed drc and isle_area_nm from the board header in favor of the config
	subtree. Removed the cursor section from board header - cursor position and
	zoom should not be saved or loaded.
	<p>
	Warn for the intnoconn attribute when saving pre-v5 - pcb-rnd versions
	supporting v4 or lower will most probably not understand it.
	<p>
	Layer group and network attributes. Layer colors.
	<p>
	Optional route style via prototype ID.
	<p>
	Optional padstack prototype name for easier user identification of prototypes.
	<p>
	Remove old model objects: elements, element-lines, element-arcs,
	pins, pads, vias. They are still loaded if they are found in v5,
	but a warning is generated and the objects are force-converted to
	the new model on save.

	<H3> v6 </H3>
	<p id="v6">
	Extended the text object fields with optional thickness and rot fields that
	will be able to override the default mechanism for determining the thickness
	or the n*90 degree rotation angle (with an arbitrary value).
	<p>
	Removed the direction field from text - use the rot field instead.
	<p>
	New route style entries for default text thickness and text scale.
	<p>
	New layer group types PCB_LYT_DOC and PCB_LYT_MECH are handled on load
	and save.
	<p>
	Load and save purpose field in layer groups and bound layers.
	<p>
	The layer visibility bit is not saved any more - it was reset after load so
	it only added noise to the file.
	<p>
	When saving PCB_THERMAL_NOSHAPE, mark
	it explicitly by writing "noshape" instead of just leaving the
	thermal shape empty.

	<H3> v7 </H3>
	<p id="v7">
	Polygon enforce_clearance (when non-zero, enforces minimum clearance
	on clearing objects within the polygon).
	<p>
	Informal change: text attribute tight_clearance is interpreted to change
	the clearance style of a text object.
	<p>
	Informal change: text attribute mirror_x is interpreted to mirror the
	X coordunates of the text object (text mirror over the Y axis).
	<p>
	The pixmap subtree with ulzw entries and gfx layer objects - provides
	on-screen pixel graphics.
	<p>
	Rat anchor objects are saved with idpath so the exact connections of
	a rat is preserved.
	<p>
	Text objects optionally have separate scale_x and scale_y fields for
	different width/height scaling.

<H2> lihata subcircuit </H2>
	<H3> v4 </H3>
	Initial version, used before board v6.

	<H3> v6 </H3>
	Used from board v6. Allows ps_proto_v6.

	<H3> v7 </H3>
	Used from board v7. Allows polygon enforce_clearance, tight_clearance
	attribute for text objects, mirror_x attribute for text objects,
	gfx/pixmap and text scale_x/scale_y.

<H2> ps_proto </H2>
	<H3> v4 </H3>
	Initial version, used before board v6.

	<H3> v6 </H3>
	Used from board v6. Features new layer type: PCB_LYT_MECH and
	new pad shape: hshadow.
