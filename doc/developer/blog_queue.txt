Ready to blog:
- QR code and bar code creation dialogue howto: qr() (needs qrencode(1)) and code128() + edakrill
- mentor netlist import howto - contributor wishes to remain anonymous; see work/alien_formats/mentor/blog for the material; please svn remove that dir after use
- bitmap -> silkscreen insertion dialogue - bitmap() (another chance to spam edakrill)
- fonteditor (can edit custom font (currently selected on a board), can save font to file)

less urgent/pre-planned/TO-DO
- Klingon font announcement
- braille font (maybe together with the Klingon?)
- CJK glyph insertion dialogue
- FidoCadJ font creation plugin
- unicode bdf bitmap dot matrix glyph insertion
- pcb-rnd -> MUCS export module based on existing C++ helper app
- metafont glyph -> stroked font converter
