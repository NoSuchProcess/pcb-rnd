<H1> pcb-rnd - reporting bugs </H1>
Pcb-rnd, like any other biggish piece of software, is not a free of bugs.
When you find a bug, please report it and we will try to fix it as soon as
possible.For reporting bugs you can use any medium you can reach us on:
mostly IRC and email, whichever is easier for you.
<p>
Using the below table you can <b>optionally</b> increase the efficiency of your
bugreport by sending enough data in the initial report that we won't need
to ask for clarification.

<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>what went wrong <th> optional extra info to help debugging

<tr><td>
	0. For any report, please include
<td>
	what version of pcb-rnd are you using: release tarball version
	number or the output of "svn info" in trunk/.

<tr><td>
	1. Configuration problems:
	<ul>
		<li> ./configure failed
		<li> ./configure didn't find a optional package XY
		<li> ./configure didn't do what I wanted it to do
	<ul>
<td>
	include your scconfig/config.log

<tr><td>
	2. Build problems:
	make fails
<td>
	<ul>
		<li> include your scconfig/config.log
		<li> run <tt>make clean; make >make.log 2>&amp;1</tt> ; send the resulting make.log
	</ul>

<tr><td>
	3. Installation problems:
	make install fails
<td>
	<ul>
		<li> include your scconfig/config.log
		<li> run <tt>make install >makei.log 2>&amp;1</tt> ; send the resulting makei.log
		<li> if the error is not an obvious failure of an operation with a clear error
		     message, please explain, in details, what you expected to happen
		     (what files should have copied/linked where) and what happened instead.
	</ul>

<tr><td>
	4. pcb-rnd doesn't find a file
<td>
	Please make sure you have installed pcb-rnd before running it, or if
	you are running it from source, make sure to cd to trunk/src and
	running it as ./pcb-rnd. Only these two ways are supported. If it still
	fails running by one of those two, please jump to point 5.

<tr><td>
	5. pcb-rnd run time error, non-gui-related
<td>
	<ul>
		<li> run pcb-rnd from the command line; append <tt> >run.log 2>&amp;1 </tt> to the command line, reproduce the error and include run.log
		<li> if the error is not an obvious failure of an operation with a clear error
		     message, please explain, in details, what you expected to happen
		     and what happened instead.
	</ul>

<tr><td>
	6. pcb-rnd run time error, gui-related
<td>
	<ul>
		<li> if you are using the gtk-gl hid, please also try the gdk hid with
		     the command line argument <tt> --gui gtk2_gdk </tt>. Please include
		     a sentence about whether the bug affects both HIDs or is gl-only.
		<li> even for the most obvious-looking problem, please explain, in
		     details, what you expected to happen and what happened instead.
	</ul>

<tr><td>
	7. pcb-rnd crashes (segfault, assertion, abortion)
<td>
	<ul>
	<li> Re-run ./configure with <tt>--debug</tt> and recompile (and reinstall).
	<li> Run pcb-rnd from gdb:
	<li> <ul>
			<li> if you are running the installed version: <tt> gdb pcb-rnd </tt>
			<li> if you are running from source: <tt> cd trunk/src; gdb ./pcb-rnd </tt>
		</ul>
	<li> Type this in the gdb prompt: <tt>run</tt> (optionally append a space
	and the command line arguments you would have used for starting pcb-rnd)
	<li> reproduce the problem
	<li> type <tt>bt</tt>, copy&paste the result and include it in the bugreport
	<li> if the problem is reproducible, please include a description how to
	trigger it, preferrably on an empty board on a fresh start, alternatively
	with an example file included
	</ul>
	<font size=-1>
	Altnerative method with core dumps:
	<ul>
		<li> <tt>./configure --debug</tt>
		<li> <tt>ulimit -c unlimited</tt>
		<li> on Linux, check your core pattern (<tt>man 5 core </tt>, search for pattern; changing the core pattern requires root)
		<li> in src/ run ./pcb-rnd, trigger the bug
		<li> in src <tt>gdb ./pcb-rnd core</tt> (<tt>core</tt> is the default core file name, you may have a different name depending on the core pattern, see above)
	</ul>
	If you are on MacOSX, you may need to use lldb instead of gdb: <tt>lldb --core /cores/core.52381</tt>
	and the backtrace command is <tt>bt all</tt> instead od just <tt>bt</tt>.
	</font>

<tr><td>
	8. pcb-rnd can't load my file
<td>
	Please include the file in your bugreport

<tr><td>
	9. pcb-rnd loads my file but it doesn't look good
<td>
	Please include the file in your bugreport; please include a screenshot
	of the file (even open in another software) to demonstrate how it
	should look and a screenshot how it looked in pcb-rnd; please mark
	the difference visually.

<tr><td>
	10. pcb-rnd produces broken export
<td>
	<ul>
		<li> Please include the input board file in your bugreport
		<li> Explain the steps of exporting (expecially export settings)
		<li> Describe how exactly it is broken (which detail is off, how should
		     it look like instead); best if you can reproduce it with command
		     line argument -x
		<li> Try to submit a minimal example: if it happens on a large board,
		     erase half of the board and see if it still happens; repeat this
		     until reaching the smallest board that still produces the problem.
	</ul>
