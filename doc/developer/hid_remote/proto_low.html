<H1> remote HID protocol, low level </H1>

In this document <b>bold</b> words are tokens and <i>italic</i> words
are grammatic constructs.
<p>
The protocol is designed with the following goals in mind:
<ul>
	<li> for simple/text data: compact, text format
	<li> for simple/text data: easy to read/write manually
	<li> for text with special characters: avoid quoting and escaping
	<li> be able to embed binary data without having to recode it (e.g. in base64)
	<li> to some extent be able to mix simple text and binary fields even within a single message
	<li> predictable parsing: always know how much memory to allocate in advance
	<li> minimalism - keep things as simple as possible
</ul>


<H2> Tokens </H2>
<table border=1>
	<tr><th> token                 <th> description
	<tr><td> <b>(</b>              <td> start a generic list
	<tr><td> <b>)</b>              <td> end a generic list
	<tr><td> <b>{</b>              <td> start a binary list
	<tr><td> <b>}</b>              <td> end a binary list
	<tr><td> <b>space</b>          <td> element separator: space (ASCII dec 32)
	<tr><td> <b>\n</b>             <td> message separator: newline (ASCII dec 10)
	<tr><td> <b>text-string</b>    <td> short, alphanumeric string
	<tr><td> <b>binary-string</b>  <td> long and/or non-alnum string

<H2> Grammar </H2>
The communication is a pair of asynchronous message stream. The message
format is:
<pre>
<b>text-string</b> <i>generic-list</i> <b>\n</b>
or
<b>text-string</b> <i>binary-list</i> <b>\n</b>
or
# comment <b>\n</b>
</pre>
<p>
where text-string is a command and <i>generic-list</i> is a list and holds
the arguments of. The command name can not start with a hash mark ('#') and
can not be empty. The list is the argument tree of the command. 
<p>
As a special exception, a line may start with a hash mark ('#') to indicate
a comment. Characters up to the first newline are ignored.
<p>
Optional: a tolerant parser also accepts empty lines and whitespace before
a message.
<p>
The language has two type of lists: generic and binary.
A generic list is wrapped in parenthesis <b>()</b> and its children are:
<ul>
 <li> <b>text-string</b>,
 <li> <i>generic-list</i>,
 <li> <i>binary-list</i>.
</ul>
A binary-list is wrapped in braces <b>{}</b> and its children are:
<ul>
 <li> <b>binary-string</b>,
 <li> <i>binary-list</i>.
</ul>
<p>
Any list can be empty. There's no whitespace after the opening token and
before the closing token, so the empty generic-list and the empty binary-list
are written as, respectively:
<pre>
()
{}
</pre>
Subsequent fields of a list has a single <b>space</b> in between, for
separation (this is an intentional redundancy for a <i>binary-list</i>).
<p>
Note: a <i>generic-list</i> can host text and binary children, but a
</i>binary list</i> can not host only binary children. This means if a node
of the parse tree is a binary list, the subtree will contain only binary nodes.
<p>
A <b>text-string</b> contains only English alphanumeric characters (A..Z, a..z,
0..9), underscores (_), plus and minus signs (+, -) periods (.) and 
the hash mark ('#') and is at most 16 characters long.
<p>
A binary string encodes the length of the payload in base64 (A..Z, a..z, +, /),
has a '=' for separator then the payload in binary format. For example
<pre>
F=hello
</pre>
means the 5 characters long string "hello". The maximum size of the base64
encoded length field is 5, thus the longest binary data that can be
packed in a single field is 1 gigabyte.

<H2> Examples </H2>

<H3> empty-argument messages </H3>
<pre>
hello()\n
foo{}\n
</pre>

<H3> single-argument messages </H3>
Text and binary alternative for the same content:
<pre>
hello(world)\n
hello{F=world}\n
</pre>

<H3> multi-argument messages </H3>
Text and binary alternative for the same content:
<pre>
print(hello world !)\n
print{E=hello F=world B=!}\n
</pre>

Note: using <b>space</b> between list items; don't space
before the first or after the last argument. Always emit one space between
any two list items.

<H3> lists in list </H3>
Text and binary alternatives for the same content:
<pre>
line((14.55 3.1) (44.2 0) 5)\n
line({F=14.55 D=3.1} (44.2 0) 5)\n
line((14.55 3.1) {E=44.2 B=0} 5)\n
line({F=14.55 D=3.1} {E=44.2 B=0} 5)\n
line{{F=14.55 D=3.1} {E=44.2 B=0} B=5}\n
</pre>
The subtree assumed in this fictional message is two x;y coordinate pairs
and a line width. In other words the arguments of line is a list (start
point), another list (end point) and a scalar (width).
<p>
Since all data comply to the <b>text-string</b> token format,
the first, simplest format is recommended. The other 4 lines demonstrate all
other valid variants. 
<p>
It is important to note that there are constraints (derived from
the grammar) on choosing which list items can be encoded in binary:
<ul>
	<li> a <b>binary-string</b> can be only on a <i>binary-list</i>
	<li> a <b>text-string</b> can be only on a <i>generic-list</i>
	<li> a <b>generic-list</b> can not be only under a <i>binary-list</i>
</ul>
Thus if the 3rd argument, (width in this example), must be encoded as a
<b>binary-string</b>, it will turn it's parent, line's argument list
binary too, which in turn enforces all arguments to be binary.
