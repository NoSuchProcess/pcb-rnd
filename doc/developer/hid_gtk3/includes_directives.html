<h1> Some coding rule-of-thumbs in pcb-rnd </h1>

<h2> When writing .h files </h2>

<p><b>Rule 1</b>

 Look at the .h file only; #include everything you need in that given file,
 directly, to let the compiler understands the structures and function
 protoypes used there.

<p><b>Rule 2</b>

 Don?t be afraid to have indirect #include`s (`fileA is including fileB and
 fileC, but fileB already includes fileC)

Here, do both includes, not only fileB.

<p><b>Rule 3</b>

 Circular #include ? : fileA includes fileB which itself includes fileA?? It?s
 perfectly fine ;)

<p><b>Rule 4</b>

 Frame your .h code with a #define allowing single definition if multiple
 calls. Example:

<pre>
#ifdef  PCB_FILEA_H
#define PCB_FILEA_H

the code

#endif  /* PCB_FILEA_H */
</pre>

<p><b>Rule 6</b>


 Name those define PCB_GTK?? according to following table:

   Directory     Prefix
lib_gtk_common  PCB_GTK_

lib_gtk_config  PCB_GTK_

hid_gtk         PCB_GTK2_

hid_gtk3        PCB_GTK3_

<h2> In .c files </h2>

<p><b>Rule 1</b>

 #include "config.h" first??

This is an essential mechanism for porting.

<p><b>Rule 2</b>


 If the file is fileA.c, then #include "fileA.h"

<p><b>Rule 3</b>


 refer to .h rules that can be applied to .c files.

<p><b>Rule 4</b>


 please do not remove obj_elem.h in favor of obj_all.h - obj_all.h is a
 temporary construct that will be gone??
