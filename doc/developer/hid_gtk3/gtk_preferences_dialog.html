<p>Size requested: 780x550. Realized so far : 780x591</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a "dynamic area" in <code>Config PoV</code> where all the widgets needed to edit
different data types are created, but then, only displayed</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GTK realizes all those widgets, which is taking a lot of Y space, while
during real user interaction, only a few widgets are displayed, minimising the
required Y space&#8230;&#8203; I tried to connect a <code>realize</code> signal to recalculate
the widget size, but does not seem to work :(</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_jump_on_code_save_code">Jump on <code>Save</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <code>User PoV</code>, when clicking on <code>Save in config</code> ?? (else too ?) there is an ugly workaround:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The whole preferences dialog was designed to be built up once, with all
values copied from core to GTK then copied back from GTK to core on dialog close.
This means if any value is updated on the fly, it&#8217;s not trivial to make sure the
gtk mirror is updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a workaround, we just force it in a state that the tabs need to be re-created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not nice, but the real fix would be very expensive. The config system
is strong on this, it supports calling back functions on config value changes,
so it would be easy to get the conf system to notify the gtk code when the
change happens. But on the GTK side we don&#8217;t have any infra or code for this.
And a partial solution wouldn&#8217;t help - if we wanted to do this, we&#8217;d need to
do this for all values, including the tricky ones (prio lists even in the config pov section).
Would take weeks or even months to get it right. Not sure it is worth the effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, on save, the dialog is destroyed and recreated, jumping at the same tab in
the tree view. This has some bugs. FIXME them !</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, there could be yet another workaround on this: we could
remember what tree node was open when we triggered this, and then after the
rebuild, we could just open that again. Go Alain !</p>
