== Introduction

=== What is the Layer Selection widget
Up to {prg} v1.2.2, the Layer Selection widget resides on the left side,
underneath the menus, and presents a list of named layers. On the left
of a layer name, there is a colored rectangle :

* fully filled if the layer is visible
* half filled if the layer is not shown.
