<h1> pcb-rnd - C89 </h1>

Most of the code base is written in C89, with a few exceptions
written in C99 (gtk, because it's not C89-compatible). When adding
new code, keep it C89. Especially watch out for these:
<ul>
	<li> comment: always use /* */, never //
	<li> don't mix variable declaration with code - open a new {} block, which will also scope your new variables, or better yet, split up the function into smaller, static functions, the compiler will inline them anyway
	<li> try to avoid vararg macros, use vararg functions instead
</ul>
