<h1> pcb-rnd - indentation </h1>

As of r1022 all old code is converted using indent(1). Our preferred
coding style is close to what the following command line produces:
<pre>
indent --line-length128 -brs -br -nce --tab-size2 -ut -npsl  -npcs -hnl -cli2 -ncs
</pre>
<p>
Contributors are kindly asked to follow this style or run the above
commandline on their <b>new</b> code before sending a patch or committing
to svn. The style of existing code lines should <b>not</b> be changed,
not even the "sorrunding" lines to a largish patch, especially not in the
same patch/commit with actual code changes.
