<h1> pcb-rnd - indentation </h1>

As of r1022 all old code is converted using indent(1). Our preferred
coding style is close to what the following command line produces, using
our patched version of indent(1):
<pre>
indent --line-length256 -brs -br -nce --tab-size2 -ut -npsl  -npcs -hnl -cli2 -nsaf -sai -nsaw -ncs -c0 -cd0 -cp0
</pre>
<p>
Contributors are kindly asked to follow this style or run the above
commandline on their <b>new</b> code before sending a patch or committing
to svn. The style of existing code lines should <b>not</b> be changed,
not even the "surrounding" lines to a largish patch, especially not in the
same patch/commit with actual code changes.
<p>
We do not put space between the pointer-asterisk and name; indent(1)
unfortunately does this in function declaration:
<table border=1>
<tr><th>right <th>wrong
<tr>
	<td><code>int&nbsp;foo(char&nbsp;*bar);</code>
	<td><code>int&nbsp;foo(char&nbsp;*&nbsp;bar);</code>
</table>
<p>
We have a <a href="indent_fdecl.patch">patch</a> against indent 2.2.11 to
fix this.
<p>
We do not use tabs for aligning code in columns; we use tabs exclusively
to indicate levels logical alignment. indent(1) attempts to align the
right-side comments using tabs. We have a <a href="indent_cmt.patch">patch</a>
against indent 2.2.11 to change this when column is set to 0.
