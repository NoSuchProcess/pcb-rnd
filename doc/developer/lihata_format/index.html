<h1> pcb-rnd native file formats </h1>
<p>
The native file format of pcb-rnd is <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/lihata">
lihata </a> based. Lihata is a generic markup language that describes how
a tree can be serialized into a file format. What the tree contains and
what each node means is up to the user (pcb-rnd in this case). This document
describes how the lihata trees are interpreted by pcb-rnd.
<p>
This document is halfway in between the low level lihata document and the
high level <a href="../../user/02_model/index.html"> data model </a>
specification. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with both: the
lihata interface plugin doesn't do anything on its own, it only takes
the data model from the memory and the lihata document on disk and
converts the syntax between the two.
<p>
The following table is a summary of the native file formats the <b>core</b>
handles. Various plugins will handle their own file formats, often also
lihata based - those are each documented at the corresponding. Note:
pcb-rnd does not try to recognize the purpose of the file by the file name,
but by the root node name - files can be named anything, there's no
"extension"; there are some files that are found by name (typically config
files) - these are marked with bold.
