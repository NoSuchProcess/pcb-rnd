Karl Hammar: (answer)

The setting seems to be just about visual on screen appearance.

If the hatch lines are short, just inside the border,
no hatch lines at all, or if the hatch lines fill the zone.

Also, in kicad the zones arn't filled automatically as in pcb/pcb-rnd,
you have to manually request it.

So you right click on the zone border, a menu appears, choose zones, and
there you can Fill zone, Remove filled areas in zone etc.

This two stage approach is probably a performance optimization, make 
the zone, draw your tracks etc., then fill the zone. Polygons can be slow.
And the hatch thing is how the zone is presented when it isn't filled.
