<h1> pcb-rnd - plugin development - external pup plugin + FAQ </h1>
<p>
First of all: <b><a href="ext_dont.html">you should write a core plugin, not
an external plugin</a></b>.
<p>
If you absolutely can't avoid writing an external plugin, you have two choices:
a native pup plugin or a fungw engine plugin. This page is about the fungw plugin
method. Pros: simpler code, less boilerplate. Cons: loaded like a script,
requires system installed, full featured fungw.
<p>
Please refer to the <a href="template_fungw/">example/template plugin</a>.
After make, the resulting .so can be loaded from pcb-rnd using the script()
action (TODO: how?). The stderr message from init should appear. The ExtBar
action should be available.
<p>
To start your external plugin, copy it to new directory and rename
ext_bar both in file names and file content. Please preserve the ext_ prefix.

<h2> how to develop the plugin </h2>
<p>
Some naming conventions and the #includes differ from core plugin
development. #includes are either "src/*.h" or you need an extra -I
for src/. It is not possible to register action help and syntax at
the moment. 

<h2> Other considerations </h2>
<p>
As documented for <a href="ext_pup.html#other">pup plugins</a>.
