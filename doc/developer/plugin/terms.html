<h1> pcb-rnd - plugin development - terminology </h1>
<p>
The <b>core</b> is pcb-rnd's core source code that lives in pcb-rnd svn, in
trunk/src. Maintained by the pcb-rnd team.
<p>
A <b>plugin</b> is a small portion of the code.
<p>
<b>Core plugins</b> are those plugins that are in pcb-rnd svn,
in trunk/src_plugins. Maintained by the pcb-rnd team.
<p>
<b>External plugins</b> are those plugins that are written, maintained
and hosted by developers not part of the pcb-rnd team. External plugins
are not hosted in the pcb-rnd svn and are not supported by the pcb-rnd team.
<p>
A core plugin can be <b>disabled</b> (not compiled at all),
static linked (<b>builtin</b>), or dynamically linked (<b>plugin</b>). This is
selected during pcb-rnd ./configure time. An external plugin is always dynamically
linked.
