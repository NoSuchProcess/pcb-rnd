<h1> pcb-rnd - plugin development - per plugin menus </h1>
<p>
Some plugins may need to create menu items. This should not be done in
the central menu file, because the plugin may be disabled leaving
defunct menu items in the menu system. Instead, each such plugin shall
inject a menu patch file on load and remove the menu patch on plugin unload.

<h2> the menu file </h2>
<p>
The <a href="menu.lht">menu file</a> is normally not a menu patch file but
a plain menu file since it only needs to extend the existing menu system and
this is the easiest way to do so. It's recommended to insert menus under
anchors because this method provides better stability over menu file changes.
<p>
The menu file is typically called: <i>pluginname</i>-menu.lht

<h2> tmpasm </h2>
<p>
The menu file must be registered in the tmpasm file. Add these lines in
Plug.tmpasm to set the file name:
<pre>
put /local/pcb/mod/MENUFILE {<i>pluginname</i>-menu.lht}
put /local/pcb/mod/MENUVAR {<i>pluginname</i>_menu}
</pre>

<h2> Create the menu variable </h2>
<p>
Menu patch requires the following lines around the top of the plugin code:
<pre>
#include &lt;librnd/core/hid_menu.h&gt;
#include "menu_internal.c"
</pre>
<p>
The menu file is translated to a variable named in MENUVAR above, typically
<i>pluginname</i>_menu - this is the "internal" version embedded in the
executable, fallback in case the menu file is not found.

<h2> plugin init </h2>
<p>
Copy these lines in the plugin init callback:
<pre>
	rnd_hid_menu_load(rnd_gui, NULL, <i>pluginname</i>_cookie, 175, NULL, 0, <i>pluginname</i>_menu, "plugin: <i>pluginname</i>");
</pre>
<p>
Replace 175 with the patch priority - in the most common setup this controls
the order of newly created menu items under the same anchor.

<h2> plugin uninit </h2>
<p>
On uninit the menu patch needs to be unloaded:
<pre>
	rnd_hid_menu_unload(rnd_gui, <i>pluginname</i>_cookie);
</pre>

<h2> make dep </h2>
<p>
After committing all these, you will need to run make dep in src/. Before committing
that, double check svn diff: it must not have any unrelated change, only files
related to your plugin.
