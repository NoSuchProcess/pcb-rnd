<h1> pcb-rnd hacking - plugin .pup fields </h1>

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> all fields are single-line, do not use semicolon (';') in any of the fields.

<ul>
	<li> <i>$class</i> the same as the plugin name prefix (see <a href="naming.html"> conventions. </a>) or <b>(feature)</b> for feature plugins; it's redundant but is kept for supporting external plugins - see <a href="../mods3/post.html">mods3</a> for a short list of all classes
	<li> <i>$short</i> short description - should be less than 32 characters; this shows up in the configure summary
	<li> <i>$long</i> long description - used for documantation; no length limitation, but must be a single line
	<li> <i>$state</i> <b>works</b>, <b>WIP</b>, <b>abandoned</b> or <b>deprecated</b> - see <a href="../mods3/post.html">mods3</a> for explanation
	<li> <i>$lstate</i> [optional] a chance to explain why the value of default is what it is; e.g. why a plugin is disabled
	<li> <i>$package</i> when pcb-rnd is packaged for a distribution or OS, which package this plugin should end up in (see also: <a href="../packaging/">packaging howto</a>)
	<li> <i>$fmt-native</i> only for io_ plugins: whether this format is considered native (see also: io_lihata's pup)
	<li> <i>$fmt-feature-r</i> only for io_ plugins: a read/load feature supported by the plugin (multiple entries of this should be added; see also: io_lihata's pup)
	<li> <i>$fmt-feature-w</i> only for io_ plugins: a write/save feature supported by the plugin (multiple entries of this should be added; see also: io_lihata's pup)
	<li> <i>default</i> <b>disable-all</b> or <b>disable</b> or <b>buildin</b> or <b>plugin</b>; see below
	<li> <i>dep</i> [optional] a single plugin name on which <i>plg</i> depends; multiple dep lines can be added
	<li> <i>conflict</i> [optional] a single plugin name on which <i>plg</i> conflicts with; multiple dep lines can be added
	<li> <i>autoload</i> [optional] when 1, the plugin is automatically loaded and initialized (when not disabled); do not set this on libs and other code that are accessible only as a dependency of other plugins; set this 1 on HID, io, import, export, feature plugins
</ul>
<p> Values of <i>default</i>:
<ul>
	<li> buildin - unless the user requests otherwise, your plugin is linked into the executable
	<li> plugin - unless the user requests otherwise, your plugin is dynamically linked; not recommended: the policy is to let users explicitly request dynamic linking
	<li> disable - unless the user requests otherwise, your plugin is not compiled (recommended until the plugin gets some user testing)
	<li> disable-all - the plugin stays disabled even with ./configure --all=* and the only way to enable it is to excplicitly name it
</ul>
