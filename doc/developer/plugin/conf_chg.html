<h1> pcb-rnd - plugin development - config change notification </h1>
<p>
All settings are stored in one central <a href="../../conf/">conf tree</a>.
Any part of the code can register function callbacks that are activated when
a specific (or any) conf node changes.
<p>
Multiple callback functions can be bound to the same config node and
the same callback function can be bound to multiple config nodes. It is
also possible to bind the callback function to <i>global change</i>, which
means it would be called on any config change.
<p>
Config change notification is also called 'watch'.

<h2> how to declare a callback function </h2>
<pre>
void <i>bar</i>_confchg(conf_native_t *cfg, int arr_idx)
{
}
</pre>

<h2> local: how to bind the callback function to a node </h2>
<p>
This typically happens in the plugin init callback:
<pre>
	conf_native_t *cn;
	conf_hid_id_t confid;
	static const conf_hid_callbacks_t <i>foo</i>_cbs = { NULL, <i>bar</i>_confchg, NULL, NULL };

	confid = conf_hid_reg(<i>pluginname</i>_cookie, NULL);

	cn = conf_get_field("editor/all_direction_lines");
	if (cn != NULL)
		conf_hid_set_cb(cn, confid, &amp;<i>foo</i>_cbs);
	else
		/* handle the error */
</pre>
<p>
The callbacks struct needs to be static because it is not copied, but the pointer
is stored after registration. The fields of this structure are callback function
pointers for different event types, e.g. "call before the change", "call after
the change" or "call when a new item is created in the conf database"; refer
to src/conf_hid.h for more info.
<p>
For registering config watches, a confid needs to be registered using conf_hid_reg().
The registration is done by the plugins <a href="cookie.html">standard cookie</a>.
The second argument to this call is for global conf change watches (see below).
<p>
The next step is to resolve the conf node's conf_native_t pointer, using
conf_get_field(), which takes the plain text config node path as argument.
<p>
If that worked, conf_hid_set_cb() binds the callback structure to the
config node. There can be only one such binding per conf node per confid,
but the plugin may request multiple confid's with different cookies.

<h2> global: how to bind the callback function to any change </h2>
<p>
Sometimes a plugin needs to run on any conf change or needs to react on
new conf nodes being created. For these, use the global callback
argument of conf_hid_reg(): load it with a pointer to a static
conf_hid_callbacks_t struct.
<p>
Do <b>not</b> do this if you are watching a finite set of conf nodes with
known names - just do a per conf node local binding, even if it means
10 bindings.

<h2> how to unbind the callback function to a node </h2>
<p>
When the watch is no longer needed, conf_hid_unreg(),
typically from the uninit callback of the plugin. This will unregister
all watches (local and global) and confid. If only one watch need to be
removed, conf_hid_set_cb() should be called with a callback struct that
has NULL for the given function pointer. (Note: this doesn't replace the
function pointer, but the callback struct pointer in the central registry).
<p>
For example, place this line in the plugin uninit callback:
<pre>
	conf_hid_unreg(<i>pluginname</i>_cookie);
</pre>
