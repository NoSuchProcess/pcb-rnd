<h1> pcb-rnd - plugin development - API and initialization </h1>
<p>
Since plugins are managed by puplug, the minimal API a plugin must
provide is as defined by the
<a href="http://repo.hu/projects/puplug">puplug</a> project. This
document describes that API with any pcb-rnd aspects included.
<p>
A minimalistic example of a plugin's main source file implementation
can be found in the <a href="template/foobar.c">plugin template</a>.

<h2> copyright banner </h2>
<p>
For core plugins the copyright banner is standard and shall not be
changed (except for the year and name in the copyright line). All
manually written .c files and any non-trivial .h file must have the
banner. License: core plugins must be GPL2+.
<p>
External plugins can choose a different license banner, but since
pcb-rnd is licensed under the GPL, they shall choose a license that is
compatible with the GPL for run-time dynamic linking.

<h2> headers and watchdogs </h2>
<p>
If the plugin consists of multiple source files compiled as separate
compilation units (multiple .o files), there will be header (.h) files.
The header watchdog #defines shall be PCB_<i>PLUGINNAME</i>_H, unless
<i>PLUGINNAME</i> is short and generic and/or conflicts with already
existing core or core plugin watchdogs. In that case use
PCB_CPLUG_<i>PLUGINNAME</i>_H
<p>
For external plugins, always use PCB_EPLUG_<i>PLUGINNAME</i>_H.

<h2> #includes </h2>
<p>
The first include in any .c file must be "config.h", to ensure
configuration time detected libc feature macros are. The .h files
shall not include "config.h".
<p>
The plugin shall #include pcb-rnd core's "plugins.h" for the mandatory
PCB_API_CHK_VER call. This also requires &lt;stdio.h&gt;.

<h2 id="ver"> int pplg_check_ver_<i>pluginname</i>(int ver_needed) </h2>
<p>
This function is called by puplug before the plugin is initialized. The
code that triggered the load may have specified a required API version
number in ver_needed and the plugin needs to decide if it can serve
all functionality of that version - if so, it should return 0 and
initializing the plugin will proceed. How the version number is interpreted
is up to the plugin: can be a serially incremented number, a bitfield, a
date encoded.
<p>
Most pcb-rnd plugins will not need this and can safely return 0 without
even checking ver_needed. For pcb-rnd plugins the only situation when
using this API makes sense is for external (non-core) lib plugins that
other external plugins are likely to depend on.


<h2> void pplg_uninit_<i>pluginname</i>(void) </h2>
<p>
Called before unloading the plugin. This often happens before quitting pcb-rnd,
even for builtin (static linked) plugins, but for a dynamically loaded
plugin it can happen any time while pcb-rnd is running.
<p>
The plugin needs to free all memory allocated and unregister from all central
pcb-rnd infrastructure. The plugin <b>must</b> assume pcb-rnd will not exit
after plugin uninitialization.
<p>
The rule of thumb is: anything registered in the init() callback must have
an unregister call in this uninit() callback.

<h2> int pplg_init_<i>pluginname</i>(void) </h2>
<p>
Called after the plugin is loaded and <a href="#ver">version is checked</a>,
before any other plugin function or variable is accessed.
<p>
The plugin should set up its own infrastructure and register actions, callbacks,
hooks, tools, etc. in central infrastructure.
<p>
Each plugin is loaded and initialized only once at a time (there are no
multiple parallel instances of the same plugin), but it is possible to
load-unload the same plugin multiple times during a single pcb-rnd session.
<p>
Before the init does anything else, it must issue a PCB_API_CHK_VER. This macro
checks for ABI compatibility between the plugin and the core and returns
failure on incompatibility (useful in the dynamic plugin load setup).
<p>
The init call shall return 0 on success and anything else on failure. After
a failure, the plugin is unloaded - without a call to uninit. Thus on failure
the init function needs to clean up any effect of partial initialization
or registration before returning.

<h2> conventions </h2>
<p>
These functions are implemented in the main c file of the plugin, which is
called <i>pluginname</i>.c. These functions are normally the last ones on
the bottom of the file. They are never exposed in header files.
