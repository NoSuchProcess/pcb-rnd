<h1> DAD: Dynamic Attribute Dialogs </h1>
<p>
The text widget is a text viewer/editor that operates on a string
that may contain multiple lines.

<h2> Helper macro for widget creation </h2>
<p>
<i>PCB_DAD_TEXT(table, user_ctx)</i>
creates a new text widget and installs user context.

<h2> User callbacks </h2>
<p>
The only callback the user may provide is user_free_cb which is called
when the text widget is destroyed. Other than this, DAD caller code can not
react on events happening in the text.
