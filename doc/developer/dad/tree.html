<h1> DAD: Dynamic Attribute Dialogs </h1>
<p>
The table tree widget is a table containint cells arranged in a
fixed number of columns. Each cell is a dynamically allocated
char * string.

<h2> Helper macros for widget creation </h2>
<p>
These macros, defined in hid_dad.h, are used to fill up the last
created (tree) widget with initial data. They return a row pointer. If the
row pointer is NULL, root is used - in this case insert means inserting at
the beginning of the row list, append means append at the end of the row list.
<ul>
	<li>PCB_DAD_TREE_APPEND - append a sibling row after an existing row
	<li>PCB_DAD_TREE_APPEND_UNDER - append a child node (at the end of the child list) under an existing row.
	<li>PCB_DAD_TREE_INSERT - insert a new sibling row before an existing row
	<li>PCB_DAD_TREE_SET_CB - install an user callback function on a tree event
</ul>

<h2> Inline functions for manipulating the tree runtime </h2>
<p>
When the tree widget is already created, typically when the dialog box
is already running, the code can use hid_dad_tree.h for reading or
changing cells or rows of the tree. Any change is immediately reflected
on the GUI. Please refer to the comments in hid_dad_tree.h for details
on the functions and arguments.
