<h1> DAD: running the dialog box </h1>

<h2> From C </h2>
<p>
Dialog box data is created in memory using either PCB_DAD_DECL(table) or
PCB_DAD_DECL_NOINIT(table). The first call declares and initializes all
variables and is suitable for when the dialog box is hosted directly in
(static) global variables or as local variables of a function. The _NOINIT
version omits the initialization and is suitable for declaring the dialog box
as part of a struct. In the latter case the caller needs to make sure all
dialog box fields are initialized to zero.
<p>
How user attached data and memory allocation is managed is described in
<a href="closing.html">the DAD closing sequence</a> document.

<h3> Running non-modal dialogs </h3>
<p>
The typical sequence of running a non-modal dialog is:
<pre>
<i>(declaration)</i>
<i>(filling in with widgets)</i>
PCB_DAD_NEW();
</pre>
<p>
The <i>modal</i> argument of PCB_DAD_NEW() is pcb_false. The dialog box
is created in the PCB_DAD_NEW() call, which returns immediately, leaving
the dialog box running in the background.

<h3> Running modal dialogs </h3>
<p>
The typical sequence of running a modal dialog is:
<pre>
<i>(declaration)</i>
<i>(filling in with widgets)</i>
PCB_DAD_NEW();
PCB_DAD_RUN();
<i>(process the return value of PCB_DAD_RUN())</i>
PCB_DAD_FREE();
</pre>
<p>
The <i>modal</i> argument of PCB_DAD_NEW() is pcb_true. PCB_DAD_RUN()
will not return until the user gets the modal dialog box closed (either
by the VM or by the code).

<h3> Running modal dialogs - shorthand </h3>
<p>
There is an alternative sequence using PCB_DAD_AUTORUN() but it saves
only one line compared to the above code and makes handling the return
value somewhat more complicated. Thus the above sequence should be
preferred.


<h2> From user scripts </h2>
<p>
After creating the dialog box widgets in memory, the actual GUI can be
started up by a call to action dad(dialog_name, run, title) or
dad(dlgname, run_modal, title).
<p>
The difference between <i>run</i> and <i>run_modal</i> is when the
call returns:
<ul>
	<li> in case of <i>run</i>, the dialog box is created and the action
	     call returns immediatley, leaving the dialog box running async to
	     the rest of the current script function.
	<li> in case of <i>run_modal</i> the call returns only when the dialog
	     box is closed and the dialog box is modal (no other dialog boxes
	     work until this one is closed)
</ul>
