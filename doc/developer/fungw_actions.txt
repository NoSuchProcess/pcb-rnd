Actions implemented as fungw functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All pcb-rnd actions are fungw functions by now. This helps the code to do
all the data type conversions easier, save a few conversions where we
don't need conversions. More importantly, this makes a more seamless
integration between user scripts and C code, whether scripts are calling
C actions or the user is executing script defined actions.

To stay compatible with the old action mechanism, the current version
applies the following restrictions:

- we have only one large fungw object (pcb_fgw_obj) that hosts all
  functions; this emulates the old central hash of functions

- before a function enters the object or a function is looked up in the
  object, the function name is converted to lowercase; this emulates the
  case intensity of the old action system, which is still essential for
  the user interface (GUI or CLI command entry and menu).

- temporarily, for the transition, there are two helper macros
  PCB_OLD_ACT_BEGIN and PCB_OLD_ACT_END that can wrap old function
  code, converting all arguments to a char **argv. Such old actions
  should return non-zero on error, while the value of ores will always be
  FGW_INT/0. New action code shall NOT use the compatibility API.
