<h1> pcb-rnd hacking - plugin naming conventions </h1>
	<ul>
		<li> export plugins start with export_; these render to a non-native format that can not be then loaded
		<li> native formats are prefixed with io_; even if your plugin can now only load or save, if it's possible to do a load-save-load round-trip without data loss, it's an io_
		<li> interactive, often GUI, frontends are prefixed with hid_
		<li> footprint access plugins start with fp_
		<li> lib_ plugins are libraries used by other plugins; they are disabled by default and are enabled through the plugin dependency system
		<li> anything else is considered a feature plugin and has no specific prefix.
