<h1> tEDAx - pcb-rnd drc_query scripts</h1>

<h2> purpose </h2>
<p>
This pcb-rnd specific block describes drc rules for the drc_query plugin.
Other software should ignore this block.
<p>
The main use case fpr the block is allowing schematics editors to
translate design/layout requirements extracted from the schematics into
a rule set that then can be checked by pcb-rnd.

<h2> blocks </h2>
<p>
Block type is "drc_query_rule" and "drc_query_def", version is "v1".
The unique identifier should be single word rule name or constant name.
<p>
Commands for drc_query_rule are:
<table border=1>
	<tr> <th> command <th> parameter names <th> explanation

	<tr> <td> type <td> str...
		<td> Rule type (for grouping on the DRC list). Only one instance per rule allowed.

	<tr> <td> tilte <td> str...
		<td> Rule title (summary).  Only one instance per rule allowed.

	<tr> <td> desc <td> str...
		<td> Detailed description of the violation and suggestions how to resolve it
		     Only one instance per rule allowed.

	<tr> <td> query <td> str...
		<td> The next line of the query script. Multiple instances per rule allowed.
</table>


<p>
Commands for drc_query_def are:
<table border=1>
	<tr> <th> command <th> parameter names <th> explanation

	<tr> <td> type <td> typename
		<td> Constant data type (anything the conf system accepts; typically coord, real or boolean). Only one instance per const allowed. Must be the first command.

	<tr> <td> desc <td> str...
		<td> Human readable description of the constant. Only one instance per const allowed.

	<tr> <td> default <td> val
		<td> Default value in case the config node is not filled in, in the format required by the data type. Only one instance per const allowed.
</table>

<h2> Examples </h2>
<p>
Below is the hole overlap rule (standard drc_query script from the stock
config) translated into tEDAx drc_query_* blocks:
<pre>
tEDAx v1
begin drc_query_def v1 hole_overlap_factor
	type real
	default 0.0
	desc How much drilled holes may overlap [-1..+1]; 0 means touching holes are reported; positive numbers allow more overlap, negative numbers report non-overlapping but close holes
end drc_query_def

begin drc_query_rule v1 hole_overlap
	type pair hole
	title overlapping holes
	desc padstack holes overlap

	query rule overlap
	query let A @.type==PSTK
	query let B A
	query assert (A.ID &gt; B.ID) &amp;&amp; (distance(A.x, A.y, B.x, B.y) &lt; (A.hole + B.hole)/(2*(1+$hole_overlap_factor))) thus violation(DRCGRP1, A, DRCGRP2, B, DRCMEASURE, distance(A.x, A.y, B.x, B.y), DRCEXPECT, (A.hole + B.hole)/(2*(1+$hole_overlap_factor)))
end drc_query_rule

</pre>
