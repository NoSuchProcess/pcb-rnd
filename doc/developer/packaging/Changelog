Packaging changes between 2.0.1 and 2.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to get a release candidate tarball in /tmp:

  ver=2.1.0
  cd /tmp
  svn export svn://repo.hu/pcb-rnd/trunk pcb-rnd-$ver
  tar -cf pcb-rnd-$ver.tar pcb-rnd-$ver

A. changes that probably don't need action

1. FYI, the html now contains a more complete installed file listing: not
just the .so and .pup files but also the per plugin .conf files.
Installed files got a path prefix $P/ or $C/ depending on where they end
up (plugin dir or conf dir) after the installation.

2. New plugin: ar_cpcb (in pcb-rnd-auto); this is our new interface for
external autorouter c-pcb. c-pcb doesn't seem to have standard installation
yet, so packaging it would be hard. If there's interest, in packaging
c-pcb, I can try to push for a make install.

3. Scripting and fungw: by now fungw scripting is at least as capable
as gpmi scripting is. I will remove gpmi in December. However, for
packaged pcb-rnd scripting is not yet available because fungw is not
yet packaged. If you plan to make pcb-rnd scriptable in your distro,
you will need to package libmawk and fungw first - please contact me.
(Packaging those don't need to be in sync with pcb-rnd releases, can
happen any time). For more details see:
http://repo.hu/cgi-bin/pool.cgi?cmd=show&node=script_pkg

4. New io plugin: io_dsn, in pcb-rnd-io-alien; it can load a full board
from dsn, which is a de-facto industrial standard for autorouting.

5. New mini-plugin: act_draw in pcb-rnd-core; it implements actions to
low level drawing (exposes pcb-rnd's native drawing functions)

6. New GUI plugin asm in pcb-rnd-auto; it's a feature that helps manually
building a board by preseting the BoM in a grouped, sorted list, keeping
track on what's put on the board already and highlighting what needs to be
put on next. It has a high eye-candy factor, may look good in the screenshots.


B. changes that probably DO need action

7. We have removed our nelma support; please make sure you remove them
from any documentation/metadata/material.

8. New, preliminary plugin in pcb-rnd-import-geo: ttf import; this makes
pcb-rnd-import-geo depend on libfreetype6

9. Package pcb-rnd-auto started to depend on package pcb-rnd-io
(because of external autorouters like ar_cpcb)
