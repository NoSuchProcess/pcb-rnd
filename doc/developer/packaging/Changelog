How to get a release candidate tarball in /tmp:

  ver=2.1.2
  cd /tmp
  svn export svn://repo.hu/pcb-rnd/trunk pcb-rnd-$ver
  tar -cf pcb-rnd-$ver.tar pcb-rnd-$ver

Packaging changes between 2.1.1 and 2.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. changes that probably don't need action

1. Fixed typo in the packages.html: pcb-rnd-hid-gtk2-dl -> pcb-rnd-hid-gtk2-gl

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. Fixed wording in the description of package pcb-rnd-io-alien:
   "PCB board" -> "PCB layout" (to avoid redundancy with the acrynom)
   Please adjust the description of your package.


Packaging changes between 2.1.0 and 2.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. changes that probably don't need action

1. new plugins in already existing packages (new files in existing packages, ./configure line change):
	- import_calay plugin in pcb-rnd-import-net
	- drc_orig plugin in pcb-rnd-core (old DRC code moved from core code to plugin code)
	- export_oldconn plugin in pcb-rnd-export-extra (old connection export moved out from core to plugin)

2. plugins removed (but parent packages are kept, ./configure line change):
	- boardflip plugin (was in pcb-rnd-core)
	- lib_gtk_config (was in pcb-rnd-lib-gtk) - old gtk-only preferences dialog removed in favor of the new

3. bugs that got fixed in packages.html
	- cam.conf was not listed as installed file for pcb-rnd-export

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. minor changes in package deps:
	- pcb-rnd-hid-gtk2-gl doesn't directly depend on pcb-rnd-lib-gui
	- pcb-rnd-hid-gtk2-gdk doesn't directly depend on pcb-rnd-lib-gui
	- pcb-rnd-io-standard started to depend on pcb-rnd-lib-io

2. new files introduced by already existing plugins
	- $C/dialogs.conf in pcb-rnd-lib-gui

3. please update your ./configure line because it has changed for
   plugin removals and new plugins. You can obtain a diff by looking
   at the bottom of:   svn diff -c 22941 packages.html



Packaging changes between 2.0.1 and 2.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. changes that probably don't need action

1. FYI, the html now contains a more complete installed file listing: not
just the .so and .pup files but also the per plugin .conf files.
Installed files got a path prefix $P/ or $C/ depending on where they end
up (plugin dir or conf dir) after the installation.

2. New plugin: ar_cpcb (in pcb-rnd-auto); this is our new interface for
external autorouter c-pcb. c-pcb doesn't seem to have standard installation
yet, so packaging it would be hard. If there's interest, in packaging
c-pcb, I can try to push for a make install.

3. Scripting and fungw: by now fungw scripting is at least as capable
as gpmi scripting is. I will remove gpmi in December. However, for
packaged pcb-rnd scripting is not yet available because fungw is not
yet packaged. If you plan to make pcb-rnd scriptable in your distro,
you will need to package libmawk and fungw first - please contact me.
(Packaging those don't need to be in sync with pcb-rnd releases, can
happen any time). For more details see:
http://repo.hu/cgi-bin/pool.cgi?cmd=show&node=script_pkg

4. New io plugin: io_dsn, in pcb-rnd-io-alien; it can load a full board
from dsn, which is a de-facto industrial standard for autorouting.

5. New mini-plugin: act_draw in pcb-rnd-core; it implements actions to
low level drawing (exposes pcb-rnd's native drawing functions)

6. New GUI plugin asm in pcb-rnd-auto; it's a feature that helps manually
building a board by preseting the BoM in a grouped, sorted list, keeping
track on what's put on the board already and highlighting what needs to be
put on next. It has a high eye-candy factor, may look good in the screenshots.


B. changes that probably DO need action

7. We have removed our nelma support; please make sure you remove them
from any documentation/metadata/material.

8. New, preliminary plugin in pcb-rnd-import-geo: ttf import; this makes
pcb-rnd-import-geo depend on libfreetype6

9. Package pcb-rnd-auto started to depend on package pcb-rnd-io
(because of external autorouters like ar_cpcb)
