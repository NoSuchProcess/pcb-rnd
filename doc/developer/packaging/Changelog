How to get a release candidate tarball in /tmp:

  ver=3.0.1
  cd /tmp
  svn export svn://repo.hu/pcb-rnd/trunk pcb-rnd-$ver
  tar -cf pcb-rnd-$ver.tar pcb-rnd-$ver

Packaging changes between 3.0.0 and 3.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TODO: fix https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=968285

Packaging changes between 2.4.0 and 3.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. changes that probably don't need action

(nothing; all changes will require action)

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. Configuration changes
   - please copy the new ./configure line for the new plugin mix
   - default of confdir changed; please revise your --confdir
     (we used to have the config files in $PREFIX/share/pcb-rnd by default,
     new default is /etc/pcb-rnd)
   - existing config file got renamed: $C/pcb-conf.lht to $C/conf_core.lht;
     on upgrade we may want to keep user's modifications, if possible
   - librnd3 needs to be packaged first, as pcb-rnd build depends on it

2. Packages removed (they became librnd plugins):
   - pcb-rnd-hid-gtk2-gdk
   - pcb-rnd-hid-gtk2-gl
   - pcb-rnd-hid-gtk2-lesstif
   - librnd2
   - librnd-dev

3. New dependencies
   - building the package depends on librnd3-dev (but it does not depend on
     gtk, lesstif or glib, because all that code got moved to librnd!)
   - pcb-rnd-core depends on librnd3
   - pcb-rnd-import-net, pcb-rnd-auto depend, pcb-rnd-io-alien on librnd3
   - pcb-rnd-lib-gui depends on librnd3-lib-gui
   - pcb-rnd-cloud depends on librnd3-cloud

4. Simplificaiton in installed paths
   There is no $LP or $LC anymore as we are not installing librnd. Only
   $P and $C remains, for pcb-rnd files. Please make sure your pcb-rnd
   packaged don't include any librnd installed path.

5. Plugin removed from package (moved to librnd): .so+.pup file removals
   - pcb-rnd-lib-io doesn't contain plugin lib_gensexpr
   - pcb-rnd-core doesn't contain plugins hid_batch, lib_portynet and script
   - pcb-rnd-cloud doesn't contain plugin lib_wget
   - pcb-rnd-lib-gui doesn't contain plugin irc and lib_hid_common
   - pcb-rnd-auto doesn't contain plugins export_dsn, import_dsn

6. File name changes in existing packages
   - pcb-rnd-core:
     - $C/pcb-conf.lht  ->  $C/conf_core.lht
     - $C/pcb-menu-default.lht  ->  $C/menu-default.lht
     - $PREFIX/share/pcb-rnd/pcblib/  ->  $PREFIX/share/pcb-rnd/footprint/

7. Change of package description:
   - pcb-rnd-lib-gui
   - pcb-rnd-import-geo
