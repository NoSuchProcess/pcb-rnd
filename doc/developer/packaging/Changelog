How to get a release candidate tarball in /tmp:

  ver=3.0.6
  cd /tmp
  svn export svn://repo.hu/pcb-rnd/trunk pcb-rnd-$ver
  tar -cf pcb-rnd-$ver.tar pcb-rnd-$ver

Packaging changes between 3.0.6 and 3.0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. changes that probably don't need action

1. documented external package dependencies per plugin

2. make install: more developer docs are installed


B. changes that probably DO need action

1. this version depends on librnd >=3.2.0

2. new ./configure line for the new plugins

3. package pcb-rnd-cloud now depends on package pcb-rnd-export (and
   still depends on librnd-cloud)

4. new plugins in package pcb-rnd-cloud: order and order_pcbway

5. new plugin in package pcb-rnd-import-net: import_sch_rnd

6. new external package dependency: package pcb-rnd-cloud depends on libxml2

7. package pcb-rnd-import-geo doesn't directly depend on libgd anymore

8. pcb-rnd-core description clarification

9. package pcb-rnd-export depends on librnd-pixmap (and also directly depends
   on libgd, which is also a dependency of librnd-pixmap)

10. plugins import_pxm_gd and import_pxm_pnm has been moved to librnd so
    they are removed from pcb-rnd-import-geo package.


Packaging changes between 3.0.5 and 3.0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No change in packaging.

Packaging changes between 3.0.4 and 3.0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Packaging changes between 3.0.3 and 3.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. changes that probably don't need action

(nothing; all changes will require action)

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. Description change in pcb-rnd: the long description listing all
   file formats supported got some refinement (eagle footprint
   alternative loading) and some new formats (Altium board,
   amf export, projector export). Please use the new version
   of description.txt!

2. librnd minimum version is 3.1.0
   From now on the first line of packages.html contains this information.
   From now on auto/librnd_min_ver contains the version number, after
   running packages.sh.

Packaging changes between 3.0.2 and 3.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version is the same as 3.0.1, plus a single bugfix.

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. Description of package pcb-rnd-export-extra mentions
   two more export formats.
   Fixes https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=968285

Packaging changes between 2.4.0 and 3.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. changes that probably don't need action

(nothing; all changes will require action)

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. Configuration changes
   - please copy the new ./configure line for the new plugin mix
   - default of confdir changed; please revise your --confdir
     (we used to have the config files in $PREFIX/share/pcb-rnd by default,
     new default is /etc/pcb-rnd)
   - existing config file got renamed: $C/pcb-conf.lht to $C/conf_core.lht;
     on upgrade we may want to keep user's modifications, if possible
   - librnd3 needs to be packaged first, as pcb-rnd build depends on it

2. Packages removed (they became librnd plugins):
   - pcb-rnd-hid-gtk2-gdk
   - pcb-rnd-hid-gtk2-gl
   - pcb-rnd-hid-gtk2-lesstif
   - librnd2
   - librnd-dev

3. New dependencies
   - building the package depends on librnd3-dev (but it does not depend on
     gtk, lesstif or glib, because all that code got moved to librnd!)
   - pcb-rnd-core depends on librnd3
   - pcb-rnd-import-net, pcb-rnd-auto depend, pcb-rnd-io-alien on librnd3
   - pcb-rnd-lib-gui depends on librnd3-lib-gui
   - pcb-rnd-cloud depends on librnd3-cloud

4. Simplificaiton in installed paths
   There is no $LP or $LC anymore as we are not installing librnd. Only
   $P and $C remains, for pcb-rnd files. Please make sure your pcb-rnd
   packaged don't include any librnd installed path.

5. Plugin removed from package (moved to librnd): .so+.pup file removals
   - pcb-rnd-lib-io doesn't contain plugin lib_gensexpr
   - pcb-rnd-core doesn't contain plugins hid_batch, lib_portynet and script
   - pcb-rnd-cloud doesn't contain plugin lib_wget
   - pcb-rnd-lib-gui doesn't contain plugin irc and lib_hid_common
   - pcb-rnd-auto doesn't contain plugins export_dsn, import_dsn

6. File name changes in existing packages
   - pcb-rnd-core:
     - $C/pcb-conf.lht  ->  $C/conf_core.lht
     - $C/pcb-menu-default.lht  ->  $C/menu-default.lht
     - $PREFIX/share/pcb-rnd/pcblib/  ->  $PREFIX/share/pcb-rnd/footprint/

7. Change of package description:
   - pcb-rnd-lib-gui
   - pcb-rnd-import-geo
