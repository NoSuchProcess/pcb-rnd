pcb-rnd is a highly modular PCB (Printed Circuit Board) layout tool
with a rich set of plugins for communicating with various external
design tools and other EDA/CAD packages.

Feature highlights:
  - subcircuits, pad stacks
  - flexible footprint model; unrestricted pad shapes
  - arbitrary copper, silk, paste and soldermask objects
  - sophisticated, flexible layer model
  - flexible/universal polygon model
  - any object, even polygons, can have a clearance within a polygon
  - advanced mil and mm grid, with support for mixed unit design
  - strong CLI support
  - static footprints and parametric (generated) footprints
  - query language for advanced search & select
  - powerful, user scriptable, modular Design Rule Checker (DRC)
  - layout optimizers such as teardrops and a trace puller
  - footprint library from local file systems, HTTP and board files
  - netlist management: imported and as-built; back annotation
  - design rule checker
