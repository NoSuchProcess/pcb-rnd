<h1> pcb-rnd FAQ </h1>

<h2 id="export"> 1. export </h2>

<h3> 1.1. Gerber export not producing excellon drill files </h3>
<p>
That is correct, by default direct gerber export shouldn't
produce excellon files as excellon is a different format. Direct
gerber export also won't produce ps or png files.
<p>
You have two ways getting excellon files:
<ul>
<li> If you need only excellon drill files, you can do a direct export using 
the execllon export format; on GUI use the "File/Export layout" menu or 
the {f e} key combination and select excellon; on CLI use -x excellon. 
Unless you have an CNC router it's unlikely you want drill files only.

<li> What you probably should do instead of direct exporting is CAM 
exporting, using "File/Export with CAM job..." or {f c} on the GUI or "-x 
cam jobname" on the CLI. The CAM exporter is designed to invoke multiple 
export plugins (e.g. gerber and excellon). pcb-rnd is shipped with 
preconfigured CAM jobs for the most popular fab houses so you get file 
names you can directly upload to them. If you have a fab not yet 
supported, please contact me.
</ul>

<p>
<small>
Note: as of 2019, for the transition time, direct exporting to gerber using any of the old 
naming styles (e.g. "fixed") will still cross-call the excellon export 
plugin and produce the extra (non-gerber) drill files. It will also 
generate a bunch of warnings telling you that this feature will be removed 
soon. You shouldn't depend on this too much.

<h2 id="slots"> 2. padstacks </h2>

<h3> 2.1. Intern copper layer shape not rendering </h3>
<p>
Does the padstack has a hole? Does the hole drill through any internal
copper layer (in non-thru-hole case)?
<p>
Internal copper layers are special: there are multiple of them. The padstack
will place the intern shape on any internal copper layer that the padstack's
hole reaches. If the padstack has no hole, no internal layer shape is
rendered, even if it is specified.


<h2 id="slots"> 3. slots (oval holes) </h2>

<h3> 3.1. My slot doesn't show up on screen or in exports </h3>
<p>
Make sure you have the right layer groups and layers set up:
<ul>
	<li> a mech layer group with purpose uroute and another with purpose proute for unplated and plated slots
	<li> make sure there is a layer in each group that has <i>auto</i> in the comb flags - padstack side effects will land only on auto layers; auto layers are indicated with white hatching in the layer selector's layer color
</ul>

<h2 id="slots"> 4. DSN format </h2>
<h3> 4.1. There are no holes in padstacks on import </h3>
<p>
The DSN format was originally designed for autorouting; an autorouter doesn't
need to know the geometry of a hole, assuming copper annulus is always around
the hole. Thus old versions of the file format simply does not have a way
to describe holes. 
<p>
Some software extended the format and use a <i>hole</i> directive that pcb-rnd
picks up - but if the file does not contain holes, pcb-rnd can't improvise them.
<p>
You can use query() to find offending padstacks and use propset() or 
the padstack editor to install the holes.

<h3> 4.2. There are no silk graphics on subcircuits after import </h3>
<p>
The DSN format does not specify silk. There are outline and keepout objects
in the format and pcb-rnd loads them on special purpose documentation layers.
The use of these objects vary from tool to tool - some tools will draw the
bounding box of the part using lines on the outline layer, but other tools
may just draw a large, rectangular filled polygon.
<p>
Use the per subcircuit layer bindings to map them on a board silk layer.

<h3> 4.3. Missing solder mask cutouts and solder paste patterns after import </h3>
<p>
The DSN format does not specify solder mask or paste. Please use the padstack
editor on the affected padstacks.
