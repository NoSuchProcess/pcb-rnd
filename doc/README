This is the original doc dir of pcb.

For the modifications introduced by pcb-rnd, check ../doc-rnd

Most of the original documentation is in texi; makeinfo fails to
produce pdf from pcb.texi and even generating html throws
a large amount of warnings.

It may be that pcb-rnd will switch from texi to html for documentation
source format.
