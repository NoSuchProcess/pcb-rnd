1. For the upcoming release ===============================================================================
- ADMIN: install new keys, generate a new crl before 21 april
+ FEATURE: property editor on selection should refresh the tree (but try to keep the row and user entered value) when selection changes [report: Gene]
+ BUG: open the command line with {:}, then right click over empty board, ignore the context menu, right click again -> gtk GUI gray control [report: Majenko]
+ BUG: press middle/scroll mouse button, click right button while keep middle pressed, release everything and close the popup -> we are stuck in panning mode [report: rom]
+ BUG: font selector {w f} prints black font on black background if the background color is black [report: Majenko]
+ BUG: kicad_io error with solder_paste_margin_ratio trimmed .kicad_pcb file and gerbers in bug_files/kicad_solder_paste_margin_ratio [report: Miloh]
+ BUG: kicad_io doesn't place subc without an (at); bug_files/kicad_subc_no_at [report: Miloh]
- BUG: kicad_io error on unknown text justification: bottom see bug_files/kicad_io_unknown_text_justification [report: Miloh]
+ BUG: parametric footprints that set $default with newlines will fail on original-awk (used on OSX) - figure if we want to support that implementation [report: rom]
- TEST: clean system install with -lrnd, debian packaging (tune the deps!)

2. For later releases ===============================================================================
- CLEANUP: ui layers: data parent cleanup: bug_files/uilayer.patch: ui layers should have a data parent in pcb_board_t and no global variables in layer_ui.[ch] (ui layers are board-specific) [report: Igor2]
- CLEANUP: s390x test fail: remove rnd_export_opt_s->value and always use backup[] in rnd_hid_parse_command_line(); problem: HATT_INTEGER is (long *) in case of hidval backing but may be (int *) for raw backing; for enum types we don't even know! [report: Bdale]
- CLEANUP/FEATURE: lihata v8
	- remove via geometry from route style
- CLEANUP/FEATURE: new breadboard
	- FEATURE: gfx rotated pixmap scale -> uneven x/y scale can not be done while rendering; change the API so the x/y aspect change is done in software during the rotation (pcb_pixmap_alloc_insert_transformed) and only an even x/y scale is done during rendering (ghid_draw_pixmap)
	- DOC: pool node on how to use pixmap for breadboading
- CLEANUP: TODO27: undo's removed list shouldn't depend on object IDs but probably remove list index because IDs are not unique if we want our operations to retrain IDs. Repro: shift-click subc replace twice, then undo; or drag&drop move selected object and undo [report: Igor2]
- CLEANUP/BUG: undo operation while drawing a multiple segment line doesn't change segment attached to the crosshair [report:wojciechk8]
	- tool_line.c depends on pcb_undo()'s return value; can be fixed only when the old undo system is removed
- CLEANUP: think over how to handle subc selection: selecting all parts automatically is bad for propedit; bug_files/subcsel.bug [report: Wojciech]
	- BUG: propedit adding/deleting attributes inconsistency; search depth problem (see TODO#28)  bug_files/subcsel.bug [report: Ade]
- CLEANUP: layer order from data
	- build a list of layers rendered, in the order of rendering while drawing layer groups; maybe use gdl and move the group to the end and use a terminator item;  get pcb_search_obj_by_location_() to use this list for ordering
	- BUG?: Far-side silk text can be selected and moved when the mouse is over front-side subcircuit. (but this is what we had with elements too! -> rewrite search.c to be a 'script' config) bug_files/farsilk.lht [report: Ade]
- FEATURE: library window: allow long tags and long location text to split: rich text widget
- FEATURE: (TT) route style upgrade to prototypes - requires lihata v8:
	- BUG: set same {e s s} doesn't work on padstacks [report: Igor2]
	- BUG: padstack doesn't show drc xor shape while moving - because the whole drawing is a cheat for old vias [report: igor2]
	- replace the route style dialog box's via part
	- proto copy to buffer - a buffer with a single padstack should also serve as a prototype copy vehicle? or just import by a list from the buffer
	- load/import from buffer and file
	- CLEANUP: remove PCB_MIN_PINORVIA* PCB_DEFAULT_DRILLINGHOLE macros - nothing should use them anymore
	- add text font, update the pool node text_edit [report: Igor2]
- FEATURE: DOC: new examples
	- blinking led with parametric footprints
	- example of nonetlist: 1206 jumpers and logos
- FEATURE: export_dsn/new io_dsn (with King Kevin and celem) (NGI0):
	- missing global padstack (via) export:
		- FEATURE: need to think over and check the spec for how to do this with no-hole padstacks
		- RTT tests: thermal_layer.dsn, comp1.dsn, padstack.dsn
	- BUG: elem_pads_ds: do not export line shape in padstacks as polygons, that kills round cap lines
- BUG: Lihata persistent save:
	- flag compatibility: save unknown, string-flags as loaded by io_pcb
	- ind: FONTS: second font indents incorrectly
	- ind: indentation bug in inline struct therm: closing } is preceded by indentation whitespace for some reason
	- keep numeric format: test all
	- keep unknown subtrees
	- doc/user/02_model/src/obj_arc.lht: Open/Save : Font section is embedded. Once manually removed, the file shows many diffs w.r.t original. Lihata V1 file.
	- BUG: lhtpers indentation: bug_files/lhtpers_ins/; breakpoint in pers_table.c:34 and debug why the newline is getting in [report: Igor2]
- BUG: I/O bugs:
	- eagle:
		- BUG: xml: eagle XML import fails on polygon import reported by miloh, test file pcb-rnd-aux poly_selfi/eagle_polygon_crash.brd [report: erich], due to input file containing an invalid polygon: a self intersecting poly in line 156 - consider handling "width"?
		- bin: eagle binary format v3 and libraries do not have a DRC block specifying restring or minimum feature widths. Binary loader should add a DRC block in these cases to the tree with the minimum settings needed for padstacks and features to load sensibly. [erich].
		- bin: padstack clearances for element pins will rely on connectivity to other polygons layer by layer defined in the netlist; test case: alien_fmt_test/io_eagle_bin/net_poly_conn
- BUG: Rubberband move line endpoints ignores connected arc endpoints. [Fixing:Ade]

3. Long term ===============================================================================
- FEATURE: version 3.0.0:
	- rename pcblib to footprint-rnd! rename pcblib/tru-hole to fix the typo; update configs
	- ./configure --config should default to /etc - warning: librnd will have its own, different /etc path! Load both
- BUG: in poly lib rewrite: bug_files/polyclpoly.lht: excess clearing into the corner of the outer poly; move the line a bit and it tends to disappear ml=3493 [report: gpaubert]
- BUG: in poly lib rewrite: bug_files/phatch.lht: maybe {m d t} and PolyHatch(0, c) -> poly offseting bug on sharp corners ml=4159 [report: Majenko]
- FEATURE: "thermal recipe" so a padstack thermal can be put in a padstack or subc and it is changed with the layer binding [report: jg]
- FEATURE: netlist2: bug_files/ratside.txt optional rats constraints [report: Vuokko]
- FEATURE: openems mesher: do not ignore padstack copper [report: Evan]
- CLEANUP: padstack bbox:
	- per layer: keep a bbox per transformed shape per prototype, then getting the bbox of a padstack ref on a specific layer is looking up the shape, then 4 integer additions [report: Wojciech]
	- when calculating overall padstack bbox, ignore layers that are not present? but then a layer change would require a recalc (but this is true for subcs too!) [report: Wojciech]
- FEATURE: depth controlled mech layers (routed) for internal cavities: http://www.saturnelectronics.com/products_capabilities/internal-cavity_boards.html -> user script, similar to on_every_layer: convert lines into bbvia slot padstacks; only when we already export bbvia in excellon; alternative: layer attribute on mech layers
- XOR rendering upgrade:
		- experiment with 'emboss' kind of drawing instead of xor so rendering can stay 'direct'
		- if worked: allow padstack xor draw to draw all shapes on all layers
- CLEANUP: layer group rewrite: remove PCB_MAX_LAYERGRP and PCB_MAX_LAYER and make them dynamic - use libualloc stack with reasonable page size and local var first page
- CLEANUP: reduce: get rid of autorouter/vector.[ch]

4. Low prio ===============================================================================
- BUG: elliptic: gtk2_gl: RTT/arc_sizes.lht - elliptical arc corner case render bug [report: Wed]
- BUG: elliptic: RTT/arc_sizes.lht - unable to move arcs which have different width and height [report: Ade] - rewrite pcb_is_point_on_arc() elliptical case at the bottom
- FEATURE: DRC should warn for thin poly hair
- FEATURE: scconfig: menuconfig and a config file for scconfig: requires a more declarative dependency handling system -> being done in scconfig2
