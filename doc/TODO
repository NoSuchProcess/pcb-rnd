- BUG: find.c: unplated padtsacks shall not connect layers; bug_files/unplated1.lht; problem: a padstack is either found or not, this affects all layers, there's no info about which layer is found; padstack update should check the hole/slot geo and update a bit for each shape telling whether it's connected or not
- BUG: find.c: bug_files/find_slotcop.lht: plated slot should connect to any copper layer object it is going thru ml2571 [report: Igor2]
- BUG: bug_files/rat_shortest.lht: because of "don't add non-manhattan lines" part [report: pstuge]
+ BUG: open gl polygon rendering: white line between just-touching polygons, may need a line clearance too; bug_files/gl_poly.lht [report: keantoken, Ade]
- BUG: Rubberband move line endpoints ignores connected arc endpoints. [Fixing:Ade]
- BUG: bug_files/rubberx.lht: move the horizontal line upward, rubber band breaks the traces (ortho mode) [report: aron]
- BUG: wandering lesstif window (window placement bug): using icewm, open the property editor, close, open, close, open: it's displaced by decoration [report: Igor2]
+ BUG: io_pcb hole clearance import: Peter's report: "bug: .fp/.pcb import..." ml2933 [report: Peter]
+ BUG: bug_files/bug_silk.lht: swap board, far-side color applies only to the first silk because it's not done by group but by layer [report: Peter]

+ BUG: bug_files/warn.lht: load, click to somewhere to remove the warning (orange): object flag cleared but the board is not marked as changed [report: Peter]
- BUG: bug_files/macrofab_rot/: rotation (and coords?) is off on xy for macrofab [report: celem]
+ BUG: bug_files/cam_layer_bug.lht: after cam export (from gui) the mask and paste layers are visible but the layer selector is not updated  - als fixed for direct export [report: keantoken]
- BUG: lesstif hbox/vbox allocation issues: test with bug_files/ltf_fillbox/ patches applied, with the fontsel action; opening it multiple times will randomly show or hide the button
	- hvbox: fontsel, about dialog: resize to smaller doesn't re-layout
	- tabbed: redisplay bug in the about box
	- re-test HPANE: pstklib(), netlistdialog(), propedit(), BrowseScripts, preferences dialog config tab
	- preferences dialog: library, layers tabs are unusable [report: Igor2]
+ BUG: io_kicad: kicad_mod (clearance 0.25) is not processed (see priv mail from Erik on 22 may) [report: Erik]
+ BUG: io_kicad: parser not parsing obround pad rotation, rot, (at x y rot), see work/bug_files/obround-rotation.kicad_pcb [report: erich]
- BUG: gtk2_gl issue. view in netlist window circuit view clips or goes black when changing selected net (repro. w/ doc/tutorials/15_no_sch/step3.lht and open netlist view {w n} [report: miloh]
- CLEANUP: unify gui invocation option printout: pcb-rnd --help gtk_[gdk|gl] and pcb-rnd --help lesstif should use the same style printing options (even tho options will never be the same) [report:miloh]
- BUG: The padstackedit dialog is larger than 1024x768 and can not be made any smaller [report: Ade]
- BUG: Replacing a subc by shift-leftclick deletes the old subc but doesn't place the new one. Recipe: Place a subc. Load a new subc to the buffer. Position the buffer subc over the existing subc and press shift-leftclick. Result=old subc is removed, not replaced. [report: Ade]

2. For later releases ===============================================================================
- CLEANUP: remove next_gui and SwitchHID()
- CLEANUP: DAD close sequence: TODO("#51.*"): there are three sources to trigger hid_ctx (caller's free on modal, close button free and window destroy callback); requre the user to always call free last and add bits to track what frees are already called and free(ctx) last; test in 4 situations: (modal,nonmodal)*(close_buttons,wmclose) [report: Igor2]
- CLEANUP: rewrite parametric footprints to use tEDAx (or lihata)
	- add "global" option for paste/mask tuning
	- update fp2anim so the web page works again
- CLEANUP: (TESTING) DAD: centralize the unit input: hid_dad_unit 
	- make the central unit infra more flexible so plugins can register new units
	- make HATT_UNIT remember a unit index (int) plus a family (int)
	- make sure we don't crash when grid or config references non-existing unit or unit that has no conversion field set up yet
- CLEANUP: (TT) propedit revamp:
	- test under lesstif
	- CLEANUP: remove Attrbute() and pcb_act_Attributes -> remove; this should be handled by the property editor when lesstif already supports it.
	- CLEANUP: after the attribute dialog, remove the label argument from the DAD API [report: igor2]
	- CLEANUP: remove attrib.o from the hidlib objects
- CLEANUP/BUG: The 'As Drawn' polygon contour is not displayed if the polygon is totally clipped out of existence even though it still exists in the layout. [report: Ade]
	-> need a new rtree that holds the polygons that have ->clipped == NULL for this purpose
- CLEANUP: think over how to handle subc selection: selecting all parts automatically is bad for propedit; bug_files/subcsel.bug [report: Wojciech]
	- BUG: adding attribute works on subc parts but deleting attribute stops after deleiting it from a subc; bug_files/subcsel.bug [report: Wojciech]
- CLEANUP: lesstif DAD support for top window docks [report: Igor2]
- CLEANUP: color:
	- remove per hid, non-backup-lib custom color structs
	- COLOR_TO_STR should not use sprintf - remove stdio.h
	- rewrite lesstif conv so it wouldn't use the string version anymore
	- rewrite gtk conv so it wouldn't use the string version anymore
	- remove src/hid_color.[ch] and src/color_cache.[ch]
	- remove pcb_color_t ->str, convert only when really needed
- CLEANUP: layer order from data
	- central code for building a list of layer groups ordered by draw from front to back (omit disabled/invisible layers)
	- rewrite both the draw_everything() and pcb_search_obj_by_location_() layer loop to use this list
- CLEANUP/feature: pcb_subc_smash_buffer() should really copy data so it can smash multiple subcs and subc objects end up on the layer they were bound to [report: keantoken]
- CLEANUP/BUG: undo operation while drawing a multiple segment line doesn't change segment attached to the crosshair [report:wojciechk8]
	- tool_line.c depends on pcb_undo()'s return value; can be fixed only when the old undo system is removed
- CAM:
	- FEATURE: make the drill exporter sort drills by attributes, an user configured table telling which drill (by attribute) ends up in which file (for support for plugged vias/filled vias) [report: Vuokko]
	- FEATURE: invent a generic API for both the drill attrib config table
	- CLEANUP: unify how output files are accessed/checked: confirmation on overwrite
	- CLEANUP: in ~2020: remove the hackish gerber layer suffix and auto-excellon in favor of CAM [report: Ade]
- FEATURE: netlist2: bug_files/ratside.txt optional rats constraints [report: Vuokko]
- FEATURE: thermal to undo stack. reproduce: new layout, place via, place poly around via, use thermal tool on via, {u u } undo shows thermal isn't undoable [report: miloh]
- BUG: rat draw undo not stacking correctly -- repro: draw a rat, { u u } undo, then { c r } redraws it [report: miloh]
- FEATURE: (TT) route style upgrade to prototypes:
	- BUG: set same {e s s} doesn't work on padstacks [report: Igor2]
	- BUG: padstack doesn't show drc xor shape while moving - because the whole drawing is a cheat for old vias [report: igor2]
	- replace the route style dialog box's via part
	- proto copy to buffer - a buffer with a single padstack should also serve as a prototype copy vehicle? or just import by a list from the buffer
	- load/import from buffer and file
	- CLEANUP: remove PCB_MIN_PINORVIA* PCB_DEFAULT_DRILLINGHOLE macros - nothing should use them anymore
	- add text font, update the pool node text_edit [report: Igor2]
- BUG: autorouter broke on polygons: bug_files/ara.lht, {a r a}, bisect; broke before r14572 [report: Igor2]
- FEATURE: fontsel: ttf import?
- FEATURE: tedax etest save (board save too)
- FEATURE/BUG: bug_files/lines - remove zero length objects if they are created as the result of rubber banding [report: Evan]
- FEATURE: extend the CAM job script syntax so that XY and other non-layer exporters can be called [report: celem]
- FEATURE: view list: import sch. shouldn't select elements to be removed but put them on a drc list
- FEATURE: drc preview: follow board flips (should be a DAD preview flag) [report: Igor2]
- FEATURE: DOC: new examples
	- blinking led with parametric footprints
	- example of nonetlist: 1206 jumpers and logos
- feature plugins:
	- FEATURE: autocrop doesnt undo (new layout, add some -maskmanaul content, autocrop(), & undo: gui view shifts, board size unchanged [report: Miloh]
	- BUG: distalign pcb_crosshair option doesn't work as a reference point  [report:Miloh]
- CLEANUP: move import_sch to import_sch_old and start a new, generic plugin
- CLEANUP/FEATURE: boardflip doesn't function properly with undo -- repro: open pcb-rnd, place 1206, boardflip(), { u u } removes placed part instead of boardflip   [report: Miloh]
- FEATURE: padstack bbox:
	- per layer: keep a bbox per transformed shape per prototype, then getting the bbox of a padstack ref on a specific layer is looking up the shape, then 4 integer additions [report: Wojciech]
	- when calculating overall padstack bbox, ignore layers that are not present? but then a layer change would require a recalc (but this is true for subcs too!) [report: Wojciech]
- XOR rendering upgrade:
		- experiment with 'emboss' kind of drawing instead of xor so rendering can stay 'direct'
		- if worked: allow padstack xor draw to draw all shapes on all layers
- opengl:
	- BUG: heavy swapd +/- crash with radeon AMD GL driver, fixed by exporting LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=t GALLIUM_DRIVER=llvmpipe [report: erich] 
- export_dsn/new io_dsn (with King Kevin and celem):
	- missing global padstack (via) export:
		- FEATURE: need to think over and check the spec for how to do this with no-hole padstacks
		- RTT tests: thermal_layer.dsn, comp1.dsn, padstack.dsn
	- BUG: elem_pads_ds: do not export line shape in padstacks as polygons, that kills round cap lines
- FEATURE: draw on move: 'Crosshair shows DRC clearance' should show the clearance also when moving a ... (not only when placing it) [report: wojciechk8]
	- need to precalculate and cache clearance shape in crosshair (polyarea!) because recalculating these for padstacks would be expensive (also rewrite lines and arcs)
	- padstack
	- clearing polygon
	- text
- SUBC: element removal:
	- CLEANUP: convert pcblib to subcircuits:
		- revise the value attribute - should be empty by default
		- remove old install elements
		- dir rename trunk/pcblib/tru-hole should handle make correctly and not walk on existing web services or user installs
- FEATURE: key rewrite: (base key swap bug (q<->a, y<->z))
	- for <char> (punctuation): learn key for non-US users
	- lesstif code upgrade for the new API
	- menu file fixup on punctuation in lesstif
- FEATURE: extedit: when editing subc with pcb, save configuration and load it in the external pcb-rnd so that grid sizes and other settings are preserved [report: jg]
- FEATURE: undo on new layer from right-click menu in gtk layersel doesn't work
- FEATURE: layersel: consider to provide a config setting for making open-group-name horizontal [report: istankovic]
- FEATURE: preview widget: allow to handle keys both in gtk and lesstif
- FEATURE: no-export attribute: cache a no-export attribute in a bitfield (e.g. flags like no-export for vector outputs, pixel outputs); exporter should set the bits in HID; core rendring should decide what to draw; use case: poly clearance to emulate keep-away on outline, and replace the old zero-width line trick [report: karl]
- CLEANUP: fp_fs_search: kill anything that gets ':' separated string as path list, get a config list instead
- CLEANUP: Mark
	- see pool node mark_cleanup
	- mark bug - ortho shouldn't use it, it should use last point (crosshair.X2); make sure nothing else abuses it [James]
- res/menu:
	- FEATURE: load/swap menus (TODO#1)
	- CLEANUP: search for vendor in the hid plugins, there should be no trace of it (vendor should register its in submenus with anchors)
	- CLEANUP: re-add dynamic menus after a gui change:
		- provide hooks and let plugins deal with a re-add as they may be added anywhere
	- FEATURE: fungw: auto-remove menus by cookie (TODO#2)
	- FEATURE: load new res on the fly (replace the menu system):
		- low level reload code (re-add the dynamic menus too!)
		- action to reload if file name is known
		- gui load dialog with tags listed
- CLENAUP: decide about exporter policy:
	- png exports selection (even in not-as-shown), others don't
	- extend png hid attribs with a flag for this, maybe do the same for others
	- document the decision in "hacking"
- FEATURE: project specific menus from extra lihata files - maybe from project.lht
- BUG: Lihata persistent save:
	- flag compatibility: save unknown, string-flags as loaded by io_pcb
	- ind: FONTS: second font indents incorrectly
	- ind: indentation bug in inline struct therm: closing } is preceded by indentation whitespace for some reason
	- keep numeric format: test all
	- keep unknown subtrees
	- doc/user/02_model/src/obj_arc.lht: Open/Save : Font section is embedded. Once manually removed, the file shows many diffs w.r.t original. Lihata V1 file. [report: Alain]
	- BUG: lhtpers indentation: bug_files/lhtpers_ins/; breakpoint in pers_table.c:34 and debug why the newline is getting in [report: Igor2]
- query & advanced search
	- FEATURE: search expr wizard should pick up the expression from the button when clicked
	- CLEANUP: make a run on a large board, speed test, with -O0 and -O3:
		- iteration speed (a simple @)
		- eval speed (a simple @ with a lot of constants in an expr)
		- geo speed
		- regex and string cmp match speed vs. select by name
- CLEANUP: rewrite layer undo; take it out from old_undo; layer del breaks on undo: can't save where it was added before. Consider the whole layer move and -1 business obsolete and rather add a separate insert and remove call?
	- BUG: add new layer in main window, pcb-rnd issues pcb_warning yet action is placed on undo stack [report: Miloh]
- CLEANUP: parent subc update:
	- inhibit mechanism to speed things up:
		- under inhibit, pcb_subc_part_changed(ps) should mark subcircuits dirty
		- when inhibit drops to zero, revisit all subcircuits that are dirty
		- get a common inhibit function for batch processing that turn on draw, poly clip and pcb_subc_part_changed inhibit
- FEATURE: holes should be drawn below silk and mask - this could be a config setting
- BUG: I/O bugs:
	- eagle:
		- BUG: eagle binary library load fails with assert when pad dimension == 0, drill != zero. Bug arises from uninitiliased st.ms_width minimum feature width DRC value. This does not manifest in XML load as it initiliased to default value of 10mil before the DRC block is read, and updated if specified in the DRC block. There is no DRC block in an eagle binary library, so a decision has to be made wrt to where a default minimum feature size is to be referred to, so that the pad/hole reading code can apply it when pad dimension is not specified at line 824 in read.c. If dimension is not present, but drill is, read.c correctly applies the DRC derived rv_pad_top at line 818 dia = eagle_get_attrc(st, subtree, "diameter", drill * (1.0+st->rv_pad_top*2.0)); Planned changes to rectangle parsing to geenrate copper rectangles, not four lines, will alter +/- eliminate the need for the rectangle read routine to have ms_width available pre DRC read. See bug_files/e-motoren.lbr. [report: Erich]
		- BUG: text rotations not quite right in eagle binary format layouts. See bug_files/tvbgone3-brd-in-eagle.png. Seems 180 and 270ccw rotation are rendered as upright an 90ccw rotation. Hmm. [erich]
		- BUG: valgrind shows memory leaks relating to binary load. See bug_files/e-motoren.lbr [report: erich]
		- BUG: on loading bug_files/diode.lbr, pcb-rnd's clipping polygon out of existence routine seems to go into a non terminating loop [report: erich]
		- layers for top and bottom soldermask, if not present in loaded eagle file, i.e. tvbgone3.brd, do not export on creating gerbers, and cannot be added easily to layout via layer prefs, since ability to add a soldermask group is lacking [erich].
		- eagle XML import fails on polygon import reported by miloh, test file alien_formats/eagle/OSHW_XML_examples/eagle_polygon_crash.brd [report: erich], due to input file containing an invalid polygon: a self intersecting poly in line 156 - consider handling "width"?
		- eagle rectangle parsing should generate a rectangular feature, not a four line rectangular outline [erich]
		- eagle XML wire elements need to have "curve" attribute processed, if present. i.e. arcs. Can see translate2geda for hints [report: erich]
		- eagle binary format appended text block needs to be parsed and the text strings allocated to ASCII-127 references in preceding text blocks [erich] 
		- eagle binary format v3 and libraries do not have a DRC block specifying restring or minimum feature widths. Binary loader should add a DRC block in these cases to the tree with the minimum settings needed for padstacks and features to load sensibly. [erich].
		- bin: padstack clearances for element pins will rely on connectivity to other polygons layer by layer defined in the netlist 
		- bin: need to refine naming of library (.lbr) elements in loaded .lbr files; any text names in the binary tree, if starting with ASCII 127, sequentially reference strings in the text block which comes immediately after the board/design tree. In later eagle binary versions, the text block seems to become a node of the tree, but a node of arbitrary length, not 24 bytes, with length of block still encoded in first few bytes. 
		- bin: need to add support for non top silk (tPlace), tDocu and top copper text in read.c
		- bin: layouts, once loaded, have issue where deselection of elements only deselects element pins/pads. click-drag of element or saving the layout to .lht and reloading fixes the deselection issue. Example FTSH.... library file for a header exhibits this behaviour.
	- revise all I/O plugins for:
		- text thickness
		- text rotation
		- padstacks
		- new outline/mech layers and slots
		- new doc layers
- asm() dialog
  - FEATURE: Add a button to clear the done status from a component. [report: Ade]
  - FEATURE: Show the status message on a group when minimized to indicate whether the groups components are done, not done or partially done. [report: Ade]
  - FEATURE: If a component is out of view when selected then pan the view until it is visible. May need to zoom also if a group is selected. [report: Ade]

3. Long term ===============================================================================
- BUG: gtk2_gl: RTT/arc_sizes.lht - elliptical arc corner case render bug [report: Wed]
- FEATURE: "thermal recipe" so a padstack thermal can be put in a padstack or subc and it is change with the layer binding [report: jg]
- CLEANUP: layer group rewrite: remove PCB_MAX_LAYERGRP and PCB_MAX_LAYER and make them dynamic
- FEATURE: layer binding dialog: manual layer binding (reuse csect?)
- CLEANUP: reduce
		- export_bom: rewrite the string list code using htsp and/or lists
		- hash in hid_attrib.c?
		- gcode invents .png name locally
		- get rid of gcode/lists.h,  and vector.[ch] (autorouter)
		- vendordrill
			- search for /units, replace it with pcb-printf something
			- add round down
			- replace ignore_refdes, ignore_value and ignore_descr with genvector
- vendor drill plugin:
	- CLEANUP: check if we want to keep vendor name
	- FEATURE: vendor: be able to load multiple vendor files (project spec for skips, central for vendor) [report: celem]
- FEATURE: lihata v7
	- FEATURE: data model: object minimal clearance value from the polygon side; final clearance should be MAX(obj->Clearance, poly->Clearance); kicad example: 1 line, 2 polygons with 2 different clearance values - see CUCP#38 provided by Karl [report: Igor2]
	- remove via geometry from route style
	- remove netlist net ->style, should be a plain attribute (but keep the dedicated field in old versions)
	- save and load rat anchor object idpath
	- poly side clearance when it is introduced in the data model3

Lesstif:
	- implement/enable local grid in lesstif (menu option is disabled)

FEATURES
- BUILD: menuconfig and a config file for scconfig
- menu item for export of multiple selected layout elements to discrete .fp files

4. Low prio ===============================================================================
- FEATURE: footprint in-place replacement should match up floaters to keep their coords, as documented in ML/2304 [report: gpaubert]
- FEATURE: filled vias for via-in-pad: http://www.saturnelectronics.com/products_capabilities/via-in-pad.html
- FEATURE: depth controlled mech layers (routed) for internal cavirites: http://www.saturnelectronics.com/products_capabilities/internal-cavity_boards.html
- BUG: 1. place 0603; 2. select; 3. cut to buffer; 4. undo -> 0603 put back but selection is lost; reason: the flag is removed in the buffer, but not in an undoable way as we don't have undo on buffer [report: igor2, miloh]
- BUG?: Far-side silk text can be selected and moved when the mouse is over front-side subcircuit. (but this is what we had with elements too! -> rewrite search.c to be a 'script' config) bug_files/farsilk.lht [report: Ade]
- BUG: RTT/arc_sizes.lht - unable to move arcs which have different width and height [report: Ade] - rewrite pcb_is_point_on_arc() elliptical case at the bottom
- FEATURE: padstack label smarter print: in case of full overlap of a bottom and top "pad", arrange other-side labels to avoid overlaps [report: al3x]
- improve locking:
	- FEATURE: consider a move-only lock?
	- BUG: when thermal and some other operations are applied on a locked element, indicate it
- BUG: rubberband_orig: draw a 90 deg arc, a 45 deg line that ends in the endpoints of the arc; enable rubber band, move the arc: only one endpoint of the line is moved [fixing:Ade]
- CLEANUP: insert drag&drop strangeness (mainline too):
	insert should just insert a new point and stop there, not starting a drag&drop
	move; the new point should be marked somehow (e.g. green-find one half of the
	object, like arc split does) lines can be inserted mostly only in all-dir-line
	which is strange
- FEATURE: display net names on pins, vias (and maybe tracks?) when zoomed in enough
- FEATURE: DRC should warn for thin poly hair
- CLEANUP: win32 port {large}
	- clean up central Makefile.in rules: remove cat, sed, grep where possible, use scconfig instead
- BUG: arc bug: draw an arc with one end out of the drawing area; it will be jumpy and can not be placed properly
	-> AttachForCopy() calls SetCrosshairRange() that then sets crosshair max* which
	- similar with lines: bug_files/dwgarea.lht; grabbing the lines for move will force them to fall within the drawing area [report: pstuge]
	limits the arc to move freely. Problem: this is not arc-specific, this happens with any buffer copy! going for no-design-limit is probably better
	- similar issue: can't move outline lines to coord 0;0 because of line width.[report: pstuge]
- FEATURE: while drawing a line, the temporary outline should reflect the layer color
- FEATURE: trace length calculator:
	- click a line or arc or via
	- start a search in two directions mapping lines, arcs and vias connected (green-highlight them, marking them found)
	- stop at the first junction (anywhere where more than 2 objects are connected)
	- stop at polygons
	- display the number of vias and net trace length along the found objects
- FEATURE: revise the importer; http://repo.hu/cgi-bin/pool.cgi?cmd=show&node=make_import ; should work without an existing file [report: TwisteR]
- FEATURE: io_pcb: new, optional "layer tag" field in mainline's file format
