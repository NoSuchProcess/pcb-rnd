0. For the upcoming release ===============================================================================
+ BUG: shape editor dialog: catch layer change and regen the shape [report: SQ6POG]
+ BUG: missing subc snap:
	+ polygon pad center snap [report: jg]
	+ subc centroid/origin snap [report: jg]
- Replacing an existing element with a subc in the buffer using shift-click doesn't pick-up the refdes from the existing element. [report: Ade]
- BUG: Far-side silk text can be selected and moved when the mouse is over front-side objects. [report: Ade]

2. For later releases ===============================================================================
- key rewrite: (base key swap bug (q<->a, y<->z))
	- for <char> (punctuation): learn key for non-US users
	- lesstif code upgrade for the new API
	- menu file fixup on punctuation in lesstif
- BUG: the padstack editor's prototype tab doesn't have an  input field for the local clearance [report: jg]
- BUG: padstack vs. padstack intersection is not considered at all! Test case: two overlapping via padstacks, 'f' on one -> won't jump on the other.
- BUG: bug_files/delete-undo-crash-erich.lht mouse over via element, hit delete key until deleted, undo, hover over diode element, hit delete/undo, await crash
- BUG: bug_files/jg1_subc.lht: insert from from library ('i') and get an invalid color reg [report: JG]
- BUG: wrong unit picked on save: bugfiles/wrong_unit.lht; load, save as, compare the coords of the two pad objects; no rounding error but picked mil instead of mm or um; happens on negative coords; see also: pcb-rnd@1253 [report: Karl]
- BUG: gtk2_gl: RTT/arc_sizes.lht - arc corner case render bug [report: Wed]
- BUG: RTT/arc_sizes.lht - unable to move arcs which have different width and height [report: Ade]
- BUG: lesstif layer selector doesn't work on silk and mask and paste (composite layers) [report: karl]
- BUG: lesstif: invalidate_all() on config change colors [report: karl]
- doc: explain the library path in 03_data [report: karl]
- buffer: break up padstack, just like breaking up subcircuits
- BUG: subc/term:
	- term netlist connectivity (r10843):
		+ autoplace.c - needs intensive testing (including per perturbation operation tests)
		- autoroute.c:961
		- autoroute.c:1000
- BUG: can't rotate polygon [report: sam]
- BUG: parametric footprint dialog: do not regen the footprint while the user is editing - revise the timer code [report: sam]
- BUG: subc terminals should be drawn at the end [report: Ade]
- BUG: DRC hilight (select+find) broke: only find shows, clicking the next bug doesn't clear the flags of the previous
- BUG: DRC preview windows don't show anything if generated after shift-tab flip (maybe with tab too?)
- BUG: when DRC sizes are saved in user conf, they are overridden from the default.pcb -> should be fixed by removing these from pcb_board_t [report: Alain]
	Reason: pcb_board_t Bloat, Shrink, minWid, minSlk, minDrill, minRing -> remove them, use values from the config system instead
- BUG: undo operation while drawing a multiple segment line doesn't change segment attached to the crosshair [report:wojciechk8]
	- tool_line.c depends on pcb_undo()'s return value; can be fixed only when the old undo system is removed
- BUG: advanced search doesn't deal with subc parts; do this after element removal using the new rtree loops?
- BUGS: parametric footprint dialog [report: Alain] ; Select a parametric footprint :
	? [gtk2] it launches a new dialog. Cancel this dialog and try to open it again : no new dialog window. You have to select another line in the tree menu, then come back to the wanted line, to open the dialog again.
		- Igor2 can't reproduce this
- BUG: (related to above?) open design that includes padstacks (i used step6502.lht), select a padstack, run :padstackedit, cancel out of padstackedit dialog, run :padstackedit, cancel, repeat. I get 'Need a padstack' log message after 1st or 2nd iteration.[report: miloh]
	- [gtk3] cancel do not close the dialog(s). In fact 2 dialog windows are created, and message : GLib-CRITICAL **: g_source_remove: assertion 'tag > 0' failed : pops up.
- BUG: GTK: "Edit->Edit attributes of->layout" dialog does not close with WM decoration [report:celem]
	- This dialog needs a scrolled window. => extend the attribute dialog both in gtk and lesstif to make scrollable window and rewrite this dialog using DAD, in the dialogs plugin
	- Lesstif HID does not have this dialog => implement it, using DAD
	- Default keyboard focus on "OK" button ? (allow closing the dialog with keyboard)
- BUG: GTK-GL: adding new mask layer by right clicking on existing mask layer, add after existing layer, select "subtraction" drawing checkbox, and set name of new layer in dialog to test. Once done, new layer is called "New Layer", not the provided name. Subtraction checkbox use directly affects manifestion of bug. [report: erich]
- BUG: GTK-GL: segfaults : Open an empty pcb, open Library window. Select ../pcblib > parametric > alf() . This will open a parametric dialog. Cancel it -> crash. [report: Alain] problem: pcb_rtree_search_any_nd()
+ BUG: polyhatch() - start pcb-rnd, draw a polygon on top copper signal, then invoking :PolyHatch() fails to bring up window allowing user to specify crosshatch parameters [report: erich]
	- Use :PolyHatch(interactive) to bring up the window.  :PolyHatch() is valid, and will perform the hatches using default values.
- BUG: shift-m of alt-a selected polyhatch() lines to top mask layer can induce a crash.  Start pcb-rnd, create large polygon on top copper i.e. over half the area, invoke polyhatch(), click on crosshatched polygon and hit delete to delete the polygon. Then hit 'u' to undo associated line deletion, alt-a to select all lines (bug_files/polyhatch4a.lht and polyhatch2a.lht), switch to top mask, 'm' to move lines, and up with residual polygon copied to mask layer along with lines. rtree related segfault seems to have been fixed. [report: erich]
- BUG: undo/redo broken after using 'insert new, after this layer': screencap http://scififaster.net/undo_add_layer.ogv [report: Miloh]
- feature: extedit: when editing subc with pcb, save configuration and load it in the external pcb-rnd so that grid sizes and other settings are preserved [report: jg]
- vendor: be able to load multiple vendor files (project spec for skips, central for vendor) [report: celem]
- feature: property editor should deal with flags
- subc feature: figure how to do in-place edition of subc, e.g. moving refdes text
- feautres/cleanup: hid:
	- "erase" color:
		- pcb_pad_clear_callback() -> hopefully drawn on negative mask only (check this)
		- holes_after should be set to 1 everywhere, then removed -> breaks gerber
		- holes should be drawn below silk and mask (maybe this could be a config setting)
- feature: fp_wget cache dir configurable [report: agaran]
- feature in subc/term:
	- new terminal attribute: "do not connect to the same subc copper" (agaran's coil example)
+ feature req: show grid in both mm and mil in the status bar [report:smilie]
- update /usr/share/pcb-rnd/default.pcb to default lihata 
	- after switch, update doc/conf and doc/user references to conf settings from .pcb to .lht as needed 
- HID: option for using a fixed background color for the preview widget renders; using the user configured one goes wrong when it's set to dark [report: Alain]
- Rubberband Arcs:
	- BUG: Moving arc endpoints in rubberband mode doesn't move connected lines correctly so they become detached. [Fixing:Ade]
	- BUG: Rubberband move line endpoints ignores connected arc endpoints. [Fixing:Ade]
- fontsel: ttf import?
- library window: allow long tags and long location text to split
- undo on new layer from right-click menu in gtk layersel doesn't work
- GTK layers [report: Ade]:
	- BUG: move the layer+selected color change from the preferences menu to the layer popup (but this should probably live in gui-config.h)
- gtk layersel feature requests:
	- consider to provide a config setting for making open-group-name horizontal [report: istankovic]
- layer rewrite:
	- catch the layer change signal from polygons and reclip; Evan's test case:
	  draw a line on a layer and a poly on another and change whether they are in
	  the same layer group
	- Layer group changes are not marked in the title bar; Evan's test case:
	  make any change in the layer group screen, return to the main screen, no * will be added in the title bar in front of the file name.
- GTK Preferences->User PoV->Layers : Hit 'v' to "zoom fit" the preview [report: Alain]
		- allow GTK to handle keys in preview
		- use the zoompan engine for the zooming. Modifiy API if necessary
- check gpmi when pcb-rnd is fully linstalled - broken symlinks?
- multi-key: display state on the gui
- cleanup/rewrite resources:
	- load/swap menus (TODO#1)
	- gpmi:
		- hid: hid_destroy (pair of hid_create)
		- cleanup on unload: remove menus
- conf:
	- remove CFN_INCREMENTS, test if saving increments from preferences works
	- config pov: change prio
	- gtk preferences: check what takes 131 megs of VIRT ram (on top); destroy the dialog structures when closed
	- gtk preferences: poly isle area widget missing from the sizes tab
	- BUG: default layer names from the user config are ignored
	- fp_fs_search: kill anything that gets ':' separated string as path list, get a config list instead
	- switch the lesstif HID over from attribs to conf
	- remove redundancy: don't store values in the PCB struct that are in the design conf
	- increments are not really implemented
- Menu cleanup: see pool node menu_reorg
- Mark cleanup
	- see pool node mark_cleanup
	- mark bug - ortho shouldn't use it, it should use last point (crosshair.X2); make sure nothing else abuses it [James]
- unravel the undo code
	- grid size change should be undoable? [report:Evan]
	- maybe other conf settings too?
- pcb_act_Attributes -> this could be handled by the property editor maybe? but what about layout attributes and the lesstif hid?
- layer group rewrite:
	- remove PCB_MAX_LAYERGRP and PCB_MAX_LAYER and make them dynamic
	- make the color config dynamic too; invent color for new layers
- layer groups from config (e.g. CLI) is ignored
- layer rewrite: central menu buttons
	- lesstif needs to remember the widgets via lb->w in menu.c
	- rewrite the central code for callbacks?
- io_pcb: new, optional "layer tag" field in mainline's file format
- extend the DRC window to be a generic location list (or rather rewrite with DAD!)
	- buttons to select one or all items or all items including locked
	- io infra for save incompatibility note with DRC list
	- import sch. shouldn't select elements to be removed but put them on a drc list
	- display number of items at top of drc window
	- export to file 
- biggish revamp of the export menu. The whole GUI is clearly designed for the case of only a very few exporters and we now have a lot. 
	- unify how output files are accessed/checked: confirmation on overwrite
- fp_board: extend the API so that the element can be presented without saving to a file
- cleanup: remove mnemonic from the menu system
	- check the central code and struct fields
	- remove "m=" fields from the menu lihata files
- SUBC missing features:
	- manual layer binding (reuse csect?)
- core lib splitup:
	- gsch2pcb: generalize plugin/buildin loading for external tools, check if gsch2pcb can work from plugins
- res/menu:
	- search for vendor in the hid plugins, there should be no trace of it (vendor should register its in submenus with anchors)
	- re-add dynamic menus after a gui change:
		- either remember dynamic menus in a separate list so they can be rebuilt
		- or provide hooks and let plugins deal with it
	- gpmi: auto-remove menus by cookie (TODO#2)
	- load new res on the fly (replace the menu system):
		- low level reload code (re-add the dynamic menus too!)
		- action to reload if file name is known
		- gui load dialog with tags listed
- decide about exporter policy:
	- png exports selection (even in not-as-shown), others don't
	- extend png hid attribs with a flag for this, maybe do the same for others
	- document the decision in "hacking"
- reduce
		- export_bom: rewrite the string list code using htsp and/or lists
		- hash in hid_attrib.c?
		- nelma and gcode both invent .png name locally
		- get rid of gcode/lists.h,  and vector.[ch] (autorouter)
		- vendordrill
			- search for /units, replace it with pcb-printf something
			- add round down
			- replace ignore_refdes, ignore_value and ignore_descr with genvector
	- mods:
		- gpmi (and other buildins/plugins) not showing up in the about box
- self contained
	- dialog box to print where the actual files are coming from, including if the font came from embedded/internal (gui version of --show-paths)
	- project specific menus from extra lihata files - maybe from project.lht
- vendor drill plugin:
	- check if we want to keep vendor name
- dir rename trunk/pcblib/tru-hole should handle make correctly and not walk on existing web services or user installs
- Lihata persistent save:
	- flag compatibility: save unknown, string-flags as loaded by io_pcb
	- ind: FONTS: second font indents incorrectly
	- ind: indentation bug in inline struct therm: closing } is preceded by indentation whitespace for some reason
	- keep numeric format: test all
	- keep unknown subtrees
- query & advanced search
	- search expr wizard should pick up the expression from the button when clicked
	- field accessors:
		- pad area
		- pin area
		- line (and pad) length and length^2
	- make a run on a large board, speed test, with -O0 and -O3:
		- iteration speed (a simple @)
		- eval speed (a simple @ with a lot of constants in an expr)
		- geo speed
		- regex and string cmp match speed vs. select by name
- feature plugins:
	- autocrop doesnt undo (new layout, add some -maskmanaul content, autocrop(), & undo: gui view shifts, board size unchanged [report: Miloh]
	- distalign doesn't work with subc ( align() and distribute()) [report:Miloh]
	- distalign pcb_crosshair option doesn't work as a reference point  [report:Miloh]
	- can't undo after boardflip(), (ERROR: Attempt to pcb_undo() with Serial == 0) [report:Miloh]
- BUG: after the old model removal: undo bug, ML#1130 [report: miloh]
- feature req: padstack edit swap shapes - low level for a "solder mask defined pad" [report: ehennes]
- BUG: padstack check box in gtk-hid does not hide the padstacks; this may be due to my failure to specify soldermask openings for the padstacks  [report: erich]
- BUG: hackvana gerber export exports .g5, .g7, rather than soldermask file-endings, .gts, .gbs, when there are no soldermask openings defined for padstacks in use. When padstackss have defined soldermask openings, the .gts and .gbs file are generated, but the .g5 and .g7 are still generated as well along with the .gts and .gbs files [report: erich]
- BUG: hackvana gerber export with "copy silk outline", only exports to sides of the outline rectangle [report: erich]
- BUG: hackvana gerber export uses .drl ending instead of .cnc for excellon drill file [report: erich]
- BUG: hpgl import fails on protel autotrax generated demo.pcb single pen hpgl plot output due to non ascii chars in preamble and also pen speed instruction, see bug_files/import_hpgl/demoplot.ptl [report: erich]
 
3. Long term ===============================================================================

SUBC: element removal:
	- cleanup: remove the parallel PCB_TYPE_* enum and maybe all the type/ptr1/ptr2/ptr3 mess too
	- remove Line->Number and *->Number: we use ->term
	- "thermal recipe" so a padstack thermal can be put in a subc and it is change with the layer binding [report: jg]

GTK2:
	- next_gui: keep them open, hide

GTK3:
	+ overlapping objects (e.g. 2 fat lines crossing on silk) are darker on the overlap; we need uniform color
	+ mouse scroll wheel doesn't work in cross section
	- zoom hangs: press 'z' on the drawing area -> hang
	+ xor draw fails after 'i' library footprint placement; in fail mode there's no xor outline of buffer; drawing a line fixes it
	- elliptic arc rendering
	- layer selector vertical layer group name truncation
	- main window resize scroll bar warnings
	- component draw "flicker", depending on pan: http://igor2.repo.hu/tmp/gtk3_bug1a.jpg http://igor2.repo.hu/tmp/gtk3_bug1a.jpg
	- missing grid points: http://igor2.repo.hu/tmp/gtk3_bug2.png

Eagle binary:
	- padstack clearances for element pins will rely on connectivity to other polygons layer by layer defined in the netlist 
	- need to refine naming of library (.lbr) elements in loaded .lbr files
	- need to add support for non top silk (tPlace), tDocu and top copper text in read.c
	- layouts, once loaded, have issue where deselection of elements only deselects element pins/pads. click-drag of element or saving the layout to .lht and reloading fixes the deselection issue. Example FTSH.... library file for a header exhibits this behaviour.

CLEANUP #7: the big object split
- remove pcb_obj_type_t from const.h - use obj_any.h instead


FEATURES
- BUILD: menuconfig and a config file for scconfig
- menu item for export of multiple selected layout elements to discrete .fp files

4. Low prio ===============================================================================
- CAM:
	- split gerber and drill file generation (make gerber depend on drill, for backward compatibility)
	- export_gerber: add a true gerber drill output
	- make the drill exporter sort drills by attributes, an user configured table telling which drill (by attribute) ends up in which file
	- invent a generic API for both the drill attrib config table and gerber suffixes
	- implement a CAM plugin that can drive multiple exporters with all options configured
	- remove the gerber->drill dep and ask users to use the CAM instead
	- move the hackish gerber layer suffix functions into CAM configs
- BUG: main.c: SIGPIPE - detect it (needed for popen)
- advanced grid settings:
	- keep two lists of preferred grid sizes, one in mil, one in mm
	- generate the grid selection menu from those lists
	- action to step up and down among those predefined grid sizes
	- make sure it is possible to edit the lists in preferences
- libstroke: zoom
- improve locking:
	- consider a move-only lock
	- when thermal and some other operations are applied on a locked element, indicate it
- Erich's gtk lag report: press 's' a lot then move the mouse - 's' ends up in the new loc!
- the TAB bug: (over ssh -X) press tab for a good 15 seconds; release; it won't work again for a fraction of a second
- bug: rubberband_orig: draw a 90 deg arc, a 45 deg line that ends in the endpoints of the arc; enable rubber band, move the arc: only one endpoint of the line is moved [fixing:Ade]
- bug: redrawbug1: grap c1, the diagonal trace gets drawn over U1's silk - it's redrawn because of the overlapping bounding box with C1, while U1 has no overlap [report:Evan]
- bug: draw overlapping lines, a short fully under a long; click on the short, it gets selected but it's not visible because the long hides it [report:Evan]
- bug: layer menu: the bottom silk screen icon color changes from gray-black to brown when any layer is selected. [report:Evan]
- GTK "save as" dialog: there should be an "auto" or "guess by extension" option in the save dialog format
- insert drag&drop strangeness (mainline too):
	insert should just insert a new point and stop there, not starting a drag&drop
	move; the new point should be marked somehow (e.g. green-find one half of the
	object, like arc split does) lines can be inserted mostly only in all-dir-line
	which is strange
- missing rotate polygon (mainline too)
- zoom in too deep onto board edge and the implicit outline rectangle behaves strangely [report:Evan]
- scconfig: check if it picks up settings from env vars (for a gentoo build)
- replace mkdtemp() with something safer
- display net names on pins, vias (and maybe tracks?) when zoomed in enough
- DRC should warn for thin poly hair
- rotate shaped vias don't rotate the shape (is via rotated at all?)
- new examples
	- blinking led with parametric footprints
	- example of nonetlist: 1206 jumpers and logos
- decide what to do with old doc - texi doesn't seem to work at all
- In-line help needs update/re-structuration
	- <lib_gtk_common/dlg_command.c>
- rethink/rewrite the action/change infrastructure - too many void *ptr1
  pointers, too many code duplication
- double sided board, poly on both layers; grab existing lines on one layer and
  move then around. If all layers are visible, redraw of the far side layer
  is slow and causes flickering elements from that layer until the front is
  redrawn. Maybe we should have less flushes?
- gpmi:
	- dialog: attribute dialog: mini parser from text
	- fix debug draw in the gtk hid
	- ACTE_action(): coords should not be int but Coord
	- get timers to work
- dmalloc: #include from the bottom from each file. Is this a good idea?!
- win32 port {large}
	- clean up central Makefile.in rules:
		- remove cat, sed, grep where possible, use scconfig instead
- arc bug: draw an arc with one end out of the drawing area; it will be jumpy and can not be placed properly
	-> AttachForCopy() calls SetCrosshairRange() that then sets crosshair max* which
	limits the arc to move freely. Problem: this is not arc-specific, this happens with any buffer copy! going for no-design-limit is probably better
- while drawing a line, the temporary outline should reflect the layer color
- push&shove
	- keep 45-deg knee when grabbing a point for drag&drop in non-all-dir
- --dump-actions shows gpmi paths ( is this related? it looks unexpected to me)
- unify gui invocation options: pcb-rnd --help gtk_[gdk|gl] and pcb-rnd --help lesstif both show and use different input methods [report:miloh]
- consider allowing negative Delta to be specified in CTRL-E property inspector
- consider a simple all in one function to create a default layer stackup for static/predictable layer formats being imported, to simplify importer coding
- trace length calculator:
	- click a line or arc or via
	- start a search in two directions mapping lines, arcs and vias connected (green-highlight them, marking them found)
	- stop at the first junction (anywhere where more than 2 objects are connected)
	- stop at polygons
	- display the number of vias and net trace length along the found objects
- miter bug;  miter crosses SMT pads under certain conditions [report: celem/miloh]
