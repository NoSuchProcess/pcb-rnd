0. old, still waiting for ack

1. For the upcoming release ===============================================================================
+ BUG: extroute(board, freerouting) segfaults (wrong router name) [report: Erich]
- BUG: drc geometry problem bug_files/TODO/pullback* [report: cuvoodoo]
/ BUG: import schematics GUI bug bug_files/TODO/usb_hub* [report: cuvoodoo] -> batched bugreport refused: please split this up in two separate bugreports, one for the delete button problem, the other for the remove text problem
- BUG: DRC: always insufficient overlap on poly-poly touch: bug_files/TODO/drc1.* [report: cuvoodoo]
- BUG: DRC: always insufficient overlap on poly-poly embed: bug_files/TODO/drc2.lht [report: cuvoodoo]
? BUG: DRC: SIGSEGV when importing DRC rule (floating.tdx, and others). no crash when saved without conf and reopened: bug_files/TODO/drc_import_crash.lht [report: cuvoodoo] -> can't reproduce: need a precise list of steps and all files loaded/imported
- BUG: thermal: bug_files/TODO/thermal.lht: remove an intern layer group the double click poly -> thermal is lost [report: cuvoodoo]
- BUG: bug_files/TODO/ppc_full.*: poly-clear-poly should respect full-poly flag and apply all islands only if full-poly is set
- BUG: egale import bug: bug_files/TODO/eagle1.* [report: Erich]
- BUG: io_tedax bug: bug_files/TODO/sns* [report: SnakesAndStuff]

2. For later releases ===============================================================================
- librnd API upgrade:
	- librnd 3.2.0+: build_run.c should print runtime librnd version the same way as sch-rnd does
	- librnd 3.2.0+: use lib_exp_* and lib_imp_*
		- export_png, export_ps, export_svg
		- remove import_pxm_* plugins in favor of librnd's import_pixmap_*
		- remove gd stuff from config.h.in
		- remove gd detection from scconfig
		- remove export_lpr/lpr_hid.[ch] in favor of librnd's
	- librnd 3.2.0+: export dialog
		- remove dialogs/dlg_export, make the old ExportGUI and PrintGUI call librnd's ExportDialog and PrintDialog
	- librnd 3.2.0+: use centralized exec_prefix, see sch_rnd r3691
	- librnd 3.2.0+: name every paned widget and test window geometry rememberence
- DEL: remove c-pcb support in favor of the more generic external autorouter plugin
- CLEANUP: rewrite query's parent_net_len_found_cb() to collect objects in a tree (from->to objects, at most 2 'to' objects from a single 'from'); use slab allocation for tree elems; see bug_files/revp.lht: {n l o} on the long horizontal line causes zig-zagging map that a single segment reverse won't fix; also revise pads ascii write with this [report: cuvoodoo]
- CLEANUP/FEATURE: new breadboard
	- FEATURE: gfx rotated pixmap scale -> uneven x/y scale can not be done while rendering; change the API so the x/y aspect change is done in software during the rotation (pcb_pixmap_alloc_insert_transformed) and only an even x/y scale is done during rendering (ghid_draw_pixmap)
	- DOC: pool node on how to use pixmap for breadboading
- CLEANUP: TODO27: undo's removed list shouldn't depend on object IDs but probably remove list index because IDs are not unique if we want our operations to retrain IDs. Repro: shift-click subc replace twice, then undo; or drag&drop move selected object and undo [report: Igor2]
- CLEANUP/BUG: undo operation while drawing a multiple segment line doesn't change segment attached to the crosshair [report:wojciechk8]
	- tool_line.c depends on pcb_undo()'s return value; can be fixed only when the old undo system is removed
- CLEANUP: think over how to handle subc selection: selecting all parts automatically is bad for propedit; bug_files/subcsel.bug [report: Wojciech]
	- BUG: propedit adding/deleting attributes inconsistency; search depth problem (see TODO#28)  bug_files/subcsel.bug [report: Ade]
- CLEANUP: layer order from data
	- build a list of layers rendered, in the order of rendering while drawing layer groups; maybe use gdl and move the group to the end and use a terminator item;  get pcb_search_obj_by_location_() to use this list for ordering
	- BUG?: Far-side silk text can be selected and moved when the mouse is over front-side subcircuit. (but this is what we had with elements too! -> rewrite search.c to be a 'script' config) bug_files/farsilk.lht [report: Ade]
- FEATURE: librnd API: library window: allow long tags and long location text to split: rich text widget in librnd [report: Igor2]
- FEATURE: menu to save 1st padstack proto from buffer to file - useful after constructing a padstack
- FEATURE: DOC: new examples
	- blinking led with parametric footprints
	- example of nonetlist: 1206 jumpers and logos
- BUG: Lihata persistent save:
	- flag compatibility: save unknown, string-flags as loaded by io_pcb
	- ind: FONTS: second font indents incorrectly
	- ind: indentation bug in inline struct therm: closing } is preceded by indentation whitespace for some reason
	- keep numeric format: test all
	- keep unknown subtrees
	- BUG: lhtpers indentation: bug_files/lhtpers_ins/; breakpoint in pers_table.c:34 and debug why the newline is getting in [report: Igor2]
- BUG: I/O bugs:
	- eagle:
		- BUG: xml: eagle XML import fails on polygon import reported by miloh, test file pcb-rnd-aux poly_selfi/eagle_polygon_crash.brd [report: erich], due to input file containing an invalid polygon: a self intersecting poly in line 156 - consider handling "width"?
		- bin: eagle binary format v3 and libraries do not have a DRC block specifying restring or minimum feature widths. Binary loader should add a DRC block in these cases to the tree with the minimum settings needed for padstacks and features to load sensibly. [erich].
		- bin: padstack clearances for element pins will rely on connectivity to other polygons layer by layer defined in the netlist; test case: alien_fmt_test/io_eagle_bin/net_poly_conn
- rubber stretch routing:
	- IGNORE: BUG: Rubberband move line endpoints ignores connected arc endpoints. [Fixing:Ade]
	- remove auto_via from the conf and code

3. Long term ===============================================================================
- BUG: in poly lib rewrite: bug_files/Poly_rewrite/polyclpoly.lht: excess clearing into the corner of the outer poly; move the line a bit and it tends to disappear ml=3493 [report: gpaubert]
- BUG: in poly lib rewrite: bug_files/Poly_rewrite/phatch.lht: maybe {m d t} and PolyHatch(0, c) -> poly offseting bug on sharp corners ml=4159 [report: Majenko]
- BUG: in poly lib rewrite: bug_files/Poly_rewrite/intersect.* (thin hair gerber bug) [report: cuvoodoo]
- FEATURE: "thermal recipe" so a padstack thermal can be put in a padstack or subc and it is changed with the layer binding [report: jg]
- FEATURE: netlist2: bug_files/ratside.txt optional rats constraints [report: Vuokko]
- FEATURE: openems mesher: do not ignore padstack copper [report: Evan]
- CLEANUP: move pcb_pixmaps into the board struct, board free should free it, and it should call rnd_render->pixmap_free()
- CLEANUP: padstack bbox:
	- per layer: keep a bbox per transformed shape per prototype, then getting the bbox of a padstack ref on a specific layer is looking up the shape, then 4 integer additions [report: Wojciech]
	- when calculating overall padstack bbox, ignore layers that are not present? but then a layer change would require a recalc (but this is true for subcs too!) [report: Wojciech]
- FEATURE: depth controlled mech layers (routed) for internal cavities: http://www.saturnelectronics.com/products_capabilities/internal-cavity_boards.html -> user script, similar to on_every_layer: convert lines into bbvia slot padstacks; only when we already export bbvia in excellon; alternative: layer attribute on mech layers
- XOR rendering upgrade:
		- experiment with 'emboss' kind of drawing instead of xor so rendering can stay 'direct'
		- if worked: allow padstack xor draw to draw all shapes on all layers
- CLEANUP: layer group rewrite: remove PCB_MAX_LAYERGRP and PCB_MAX_LAYER and make them dynamic - use libualloc stack with reasonable page size and local var first page
	- make pcb_layervis_save_stack() reentrant by letting the caller allocate the save buffer
- CLEANUP: reduce: get rid of autorouter/vector.[ch]

4. Low prio ===============================================================================
- BUG: elliptic: gtk2_gl: RTT/arc_sizes.lht - elliptical arc corner case render bug [report: Wed]
- BUG: elliptic: RTT/arc_sizes.lht - unable to move arcs which have different width and height [report: Ade] - rewrite pcb_is_point_on_arc() elliptical case at the bottom
- FEATURE: DRC should warn for thin poly hair
- FEATURE: scconfig: menuconfig and a config file for scconfig: requires a more declarative dependency handling system -> being done in scconfig2
