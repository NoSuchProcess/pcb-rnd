1. For the upcoming release ===============================================================================
- BUG: gtk2: shift+D on an element crashes [report: sam]
- padstack:
	- BUG: exports:
		+ png export doesn't show padstack holes [report: Ade]
		+ gerber export (plated, unplated drill cnc) doesn't have padstacks [report: Ade]
		- ps hole generation is broken
	- BUG: 'send to other side' with padstacks in subc: should mirror layer stack positions in the proto
	- v4 lihata formatting
	- BUG: Converting selection to padstack uses mouse pointer instead of crosshair for origin [report: Ade]
	- property editor doesn't deal with padstacks (and subc)
	- test if advanced search does anything with padstacks (and subc)
	- change layer stackup and padstack thermals will break
	- BUG: 'padstackedit' action doesn't find padstacks in a subc. [report: Ade]
+ BUG: subc netlisting broke (no rats are drawn to padstacks in subc) [report: Ade]
+ BUG: {import::src0} doesn't substitute ~ [report: Ade]
- BUG: subc terminals should be drawn at the end [report: Ade]
- BUG: png export: photo mode or as-shown: implicit mask layer, mask cutout over pins don't render properly [report: keantoken]
+ BUG: shift+b doesn't work on subc [report: Ade]
- feature: property editor should deal with flags
- BUG: property editor arc delta value: #-75 shouldn't be switched to positive [report: Erich]
+ BUG: label drawing (delayed_draw) happens too soon: it must not happen before we finish drawing all layers [report: jg, Ade]
- BUG: csect can't make a layer outline
- BUGS: parametric footprint dialog [report: Alain] ; Select a parametric footprint :
	- [gtk2] it launches a new dialog. Cancel this dialog and try to open it again : no new dialog window. You have to select another line in the tree menu, then come back to the wanted line, to open the dialog again.
	- [gtk3] cancel do not close the dialog(s). In fact 2 dialog windows are created, and message : GLib-CRITICAL **: g_source_remove: assertion 'tag > 0' failed : pops up.
- BUG: autosave leaks memory (when pcb-rnd is left there for long) [report: jg]
- BUG: subc/term:
	- term netlist connectivity r10843:
		- autoplace.c:167
		- autoroute.c:961
		- autoroute.c:1000
		- smartdisperse.c:128 -> needs a generic subc revamp (grep for element)
- BUG: gtk2 opengl ignores local grid
- BUG: GTK: "Edit->Edit attributes of->layout" dialog does not close with WM decoration [report:celem]
	- This dialog needs a scrolled window. => extend the attribute dialog both in gtk and lesstif to make scrollable window and rewrite this dialog using DAD, in the dialogs plugin
	- Lesstif HID does not have this dialog => implement it, using DAD
	- Default keyboard focus on "OK" button ? (allow closing the dialog with keyboard)
? BUG: attribute dialog (on via): I opened the attribute editor again to delete any attributes I added. It showed p=new as an attribute. Deleting that attribute caused pcb-rnd to crash. Looks like deleting the last attribute in the attribute editor and then opening it again caused it to take whatever is behind it in the heap as an attribute. [report: keantoken]
- BUG: when DRC sizes are saved in user conf, they are overridden from the default.pcb -> should be fixed by removing these from pcb_board_t [report: Alain]
	Reason: pcb_board_t Bloat, Shrink, minWid, minSlk, minDrill, minRing -> remove them, use values from the config system instead
+ BUG: cycledrag doesn't work on arc endpoint + line endpoint when rubber band is enabled [report/fixing:Ade]
- vendor: be able to load multiple vendor files (project spec for skips, central for vendor) [report: celem]
- BUG: missing subc snap:
	- polygon pad center snap [report: jg]
	+ subc centroid/origin snap [report: jg]
- BUG: opengl bug: load a layout with subc, copy/paste the subc a few times. select one, move the mouse across the bounding box boundry of unselected copies, the silk refdes floater of the unselected copies blinks out.[report:miloh]
- BUG: undo operation while drawing a multiple segment line doesn't change segment attached to the crosshair [report:wojciechk8]
- BUG: selection doesn't work properly (introduced in r12152) [report:wojciechk8]
- BUG: no mask cutouts in photo-mode png export [report:wojciechk8]
- BUG: pinout (D) of subcircuit terminals is shown on both sides of the board (should be shown only on the view side) [report:wojciechk8]
- BUG: png export: photo_groups[] breaks shadow rendering of internal layers and other-sides in photo mode; rewrite the code to omit this array and do direct layergrp queries [report: keantoken]
- BUG: inconsistency between undo/redo (related with pcb_tool_redo_act, not the undo code itself), ie.: [report:wojciechk8]
	- when drawing a ractangle undo action is not allowed, but redo is
	- when drawing outline segments of a polygon, undo removes previous segment, but redo does nothing
- BUG: subc: shift-tab, red refdes printout is out of the box
- BUG: DRC hilight (select+find) broke: only find shows, clicking the next bug doesn't clear the flags of the previous
- BUG: DRC preview windows don't show anything if generated after shift-tab flip (maybe with tab too?)
+ BUG: open pcb from cli with filename as argument, gui hangs.  (ex. fromsrcdir `./pcb-rnd ./`) https://pastebin.com/raw/hgzy5rHP [report:miloh]
- BUG: round rect thermal: when poly points are too close together, it goes wrong
- autocrop asserts on boards with subc with padstack (rtree)

2. For later releases ===============================================================================
- key rewrite: (base key swap bug (q<->a, y<->z))
	- for <char> (punctuation): learn key for non-US users
	- lesstif code upgrade for the new API
	- menu file fixup on punctuation in lesstif
- BUG: import (any format) and click cancel in the file selector: shouldn't get a syntax error [report:keantoken]
- subc feature: figure how to do in-place edition of subc, e.g. moving refdes text
- feautres/cleanup: hid:
	- "erase" color:
		- pcb_pad_clear_callback() -> hopefully drawn on negative mask only (check this)
		- holes_after should be set to 1 everywhere, then removed -> breaks gerber
		- holes should be drawn below silk and mask (maybe this could be a config setting)
- feature: fp_wget cache dir confiurable [report: agaran]
- feature in subc/term:
	- new terminal attribute: "do not connect to the same subc copper" (agaran's coil example)
+ feature req: show grid in both mm and mil in the status bar [report:smilie]
- update /usr/share/pcb-rnd/default.pcb to default lihata 
	- after switch, update doc/conf and doc/user references to conf settings from .pcb to .lht as needed 
- HID: option for using a fixed background color for the preview widget renders; using the user configured one goes wrong when it's set to dark [report: Alain]
- Rubberband Arcs:
	- Moving arc endpoints in rubberband mode doesn't move connected lines correctly so they become detached. [Fixing:Ade]
	- Rubberband move line endpoints ignores connected arc endpoints. [Fixing:Ade]
- fontsel: ttf import?
- library window: allow long tags and long location text to split
- undo on new layer from right-click menu in gtk layersel doesn't work
- GTK layers [report: Ade]:
	- move the layer+selected color change from the preferences menu to the layer popup (but this should probably live in gui-config.h)
- gtk layersel feature requests:
	- consider to provide a config setting for making open-group-name horizontal [report: istankovic]
- layer rewrite:
	- catch the layer change signal from polygons and reclip; Evan's test case:
	  draw a line on a layer and a poly on another and change whether they are in
	  the same layer group
	- Layer group changes are not marked in the title bar; Evan's test case:
	  make any change in the layer group screen, return to the main screen, no * will be added in the title bar in front of the file name.
- GTK Preferences->User PoV->Layers : Hit 'v' to "zoom fit" the preview [report: Alain]
		- allow GTK to handle keys in preview
		- use the zoompan engine for the zooming. Modifiy API if necessary
- check gpmi when pcb-rnd is fully linstalled - broken symlinks?
- multi-key: display state on the gui
- cleanup/rewrite resources:
	- load/swap menus (TODO#1)
	- gpmi:
		- hid: hid_destroy (pair of hid_create)
		- cleanup on unload: remove menus
- look for #warnings
- conf:
	- remove CFN_INCREMENTS, test if saving increments from preferences works
	- config pov: change prio
	- gtk preferences: check what takes 131 megs of VIRT ram (on top); destroy the dialog structures when closed
	- gtk preferences: poly isle area widget missing from the sizes tab
	- debug why default layer names from the user config are ignored
	- fp_fs_search: kill anything that gets ':' separated string as path list, get a config list instead
	- switch the lesstif HID over from attribs to conf
	- remove redundancy: don't store values in the PCB struct that are in the design conf
	- increments are not really implemented
- mark bug - ortho shouldn't use it, it should use last point (crosshair.X2); make sure nothing else abuses it [James]
- unravel the undo code
	- grid size change should be undoable? [report:Evan]
	- maybe other conf settings too?
- pcb_act_Attributes -> this could be handled by the property editor maybe? but what about layout attributes and the lesstif hid?
- layer group rewrite:
	- remove PCB_MAX_LAYERGRP and PCB_MAX_LAYER and make them dynamic
	- make the color config dynamic too; invent color for new layers
- layer groups from config (e.g. CLI) is ignored
- layer rewrite: central menu buttons
	- lesstif needs to remember the widgets via lb->w in menu.c
	- rewrite the central code for callbacks?
- inconsistencies in UI/terminology:
	+ report dialog should use the same terminology for clearances as elements and route style dialog [report: miloh]
- io_pcb: new, optional "layer tag" field in mainline's file format
- extend the DRC window to be a generic location list
	- buttons to select one or all items or all items including locked
	- io infra for save incompatibility note with DRC list
	- import sch. shouldn't select elements to be removed but put them on a drc list
	- display number of items at top of drc window
	- export to file 
- biggish revamp of the export menu. The whole GUI is clearly designed for the case of only a very few exporters and we now have a lot. 
	- unify how output files are accessed/checked: confirmation on overwrite
- fp_board: extend the API so that the element can be presented without saving to a file
- cleanup: remove mnemonic from the menu system
	- check the central code and struct fields
	- remove "m=" fields from the menu lihata files
- SUBC missing features:
	- manual layer binding (reuse csect?)
	- ctrl+e propedig on subc
+ parametric footprint gtk attribute box for editing: also mention the default value in the tooltip [report: agaran]
- core lib splitup:
	- gsch2pcb: generalize plugin/buildin loading for external tools, check if gsch2pcb can work from plugins
- res:
	- search for vendor in the hid plugins, there should be no trace of it (vendor should register its in submenus with anchors)
	- re-add dynamic menus after a gui change:
		- either remember dynamic menus in a separate list so they can be rebuilt
		- or provide hooks and let plugins deal with it
	- gpmi: auto-remove menus by cookie (TODO#2)
	- load new res on the fly (replace the menu system):
		- low level reload code (re-add the dynamic menus too!)
		- action to reload if file name is known
		- gui load dialog with tags listed
- decide about exporter policy:
	- png exports selection (even in not-as-shown), others don't
	- extend png hid attribs with a flag for this, maybe do the same for others
	- document the decision in "hacking"
- reduce
		- export_bom: rewrite the string list code using htsp and/or lists
		- hash in hid_attrib.c?
		- nelma and gcode both invent .png name locally
		- get rid of gcode/lists.h,  and vector.[ch] (autorouter)
		- vendordrill
			- search for /units, replace it with pcb-printf something
			- add round down
			- replace ignore_refdes, ignore_value and ignore_descr with genvector
	- mods:
		- gpmi (and other buildins/plugins) not showing up in the about box
- self contained
	- dialog box to print where the actual files are coming from, including if the font came from embedded/internal (gui version of --show-paths)
	- project specific menus from extra lihata files - maybe from project.lht
- vendor drill plugin:
	- check if we want to keep vendor name
- main.c:
	- SIGPIPE - detect it (needed for popen)
- dir rename trunk/pcblib/tru-hole should handle make correctly and not walk on existing web services or user installs
- Lihata persistent save:
	- flag compatibility: save unknown, string-flags as loaded by io_pcb
	- ind: FONTS: second font indents incorrectly
	- ind: indentation bug in inline struct therm: closing } is preceded by indentation whitespace for some reason
	- keep numeric format: test all
	- keep unknown subtrees

- query & advanced search
	- search expr wizard should pick up the expression from the button when clicked
	- field accessors:
		- pad area
		- pin area
		- line (and pad) length and length^2
	- make a run on a large board, speed test, with -O0 and -O3:
		- iteration speed (a simple @)
		- eval speed (a simple @ with a lot of constants in an expr)
		- geo speed
		- regex and string cmp match speed vs. select by name
- feature plugins:
	- autocrop doesnt undo (new layout, add some -maskmanaul content, autocrop(), & undo: gui view shifts, board size unchanged [report: Miloh]
	- distalign doesn't work with subc ( align() and distribute()) [report:Miloh]
	- distalign pcb_crosshair option doesn't work as a reference point  [report:Miloh]
	- can't undo after boardflip(), (ERROR: Attempt to pcb_undo() with Serial == 0) [report:Miloh]

3. Long term ===============================================================================

SUBC: element removal:
	- cleanup: remove the parallel PCB_TYPE_* enum and maybe all the type/ptr1/ptr2/ptr3 mess too
	- remove Line->Number and *->Number: we use ->term

GTK2:
	- next_gui: keep them open, hide

GTK3:
	+ overlapping objects (e.g. 2 fat lines crossing on silk) are darker on the overlap; we need uniform color
	+ mouse scroll wheel doesn't work in cross section
	- zoom hangs: press 'z' on the drawing area -> hang
	+ xor draw fails after 'i' library footprint placement; in fail mode there's no xor outline of buffer; drawing a line fixes it
	- elliptic arc rendering
	- layer selector vertical layer group name truncation
	- main window resize scroll bar warnings
	- component draw "flicker", depending on pan: http://igor2.repo.hu/tmp/gtk3_bug1a.jpg http://igor2.repo.hu/tmp/gtk3_bug1a.jpg
	- missing grid points: http://igor2.repo.hu/tmp/gtk3_bug2.png

Eagle binary:
	- netlist nodes are defined in
			board/1b00->signals/0000->signal/1c00->contactref/3e00
		- NB signal nodes can have signal subnodes, which we may need to flatten for connected nets
	- need to decide what to do with Eagles incompatible netnames '-' and '+'
	- need to refine naming of library (.lbr) elements in loaded .lbr files
	- need to iron out CW vs CCW arc rendering issue seen on 80m SSB Tx transistors on tDocu layer 
	- need to add support for non top silk (tPlace), tDocu and top copper text in read.c

CLEANUP #7: the big object split
- remove pcb_obj_type_t from const.h - use obj_any.h instead


FEATURES
- BUILD: menuconfig and a config file for scconfig
- menu item for export of multiple selected layout elements to discrete .fp files

4. Low prio ===============================================================================

- advanced grid settings:
	- keep two lists of preferred grid sizes, one in mil, one in mm
	- generate the grid selection menu from those lists
	- action to step up and down among those predefined grid sizes
	- make sure it is possible to edit the lists in preferences
- libstroke: zoom
- improve locking:
	- consider a move-only lock
	- when thermal and some other operations are applied on a locked element, indicate it
- Erich's gtk lag report: press 's' a lot then move the mouse - 's' ends up in the new loc!
- the TAB bug: (over ssh -X) press tab for a good 15 seconds; release; it won't work again for a fraction of a second
- bug: rubberband_orig: draw a 90 deg arc, a 45 deg line that ends in the endpoints of the arc; enable rubber band, move the arc: only one endpoint of the line is moved [fixing:Ade]
- bug: redrawbug1: grap c1, the diagonal trace gets drawn over U1's silk - it's redrawn because of the overlapping bounding box with C1, while U1 has no overlap [report:Evan]
- bug: draw overlapping lines, a short fully under a long; click on the short, it gets selected but it's not visible because the long hides it [report:Evan]
- bug: layer menu: the bottom silk screen icon color changes from gray-black to brown when any layer is selected. [report:Evan]
- GTK "save as" dialog: there should be an "auto" or "guess by extension" option in the save dialog format
- insert drag&drop strangeness (mainline too):
	insert should just insert a new point and stop there, not starting a drag&drop
	move; the new point should be marked somehow (e.g. green-find one half of the
	object, like arc split does) lines can be inserted mostly only in all-dir-line
	which is strange
- missing rotate polygon (mainline too)
- zoom in too deep onto board edge and the implicit outline rectangle behaves strangely [report:Evan]
- scconfig: check if it picks up settings from env vars (for a gentoo build)
- replace mkdtemp() with something safer
- display net names on pins, vias (and maybe tracks?) when zoomed in enough
- DRC should warn for thin poly hair
- rotate shaped vias don't rotate the shape (is via rotated at all?)
- new examples
	- blinking led with parametric footprints
	- example of nonetlist: 1206 jumpers and logos
- decide what to do with old doc - texi doesn't seem to work at all
- rethink/rewrite the action/change infrastructure - too many void *ptr1
  pointers, too many code duplication
- double sided board, poly on both layers; grab existing lines on one layer and
  move then around. If all layers are visible, redraw of the far side layer
  is slow and causes flickering elements from that layer until the front is
  redrawn. Maybe we should have less flushes?
- gpmi:
	- dialog: attribute dialog: mini parser from text
	- fix debug draw in the gtk hid
	- ACTE_action(): coords should not be int but Coord
	- get timers to work
- dmalloc: #include from the bottom from each file. Is this a good idea?!
- win32 port {large}
	- clean up central Makefile.in rules:
		- remove cat, sed, grep where possible, use scconfig instead
- arc bug: draw an arc with one end out of the drawing area; it will be jumpy and can not be placed properly
	-> AttachForCopy() calls SetCrosshairRange() that then sets crosshair max* which
	limits the arc to move freely. Problem: this is not arc-specific, this happens with any buffer copy! going for no-design-limit is probably better
- while drawing a line, the temporary outline should reflect the layer color
- push&shove
	- keep 45-deg knee when grabbing a point for drag&drop in non-all-dir
- --dump-actions shows gpmi paths ( is this related? it looks unexpected to me)
- unify gui invocation options: pcb-rnd --help gtk_[gdk|gl] and pcb-rnd --help lesstif both show and use different input methods [report:miloh]
- consider allowing negative Delta to be specified in CTRL-E property inspector
- consider a simple all in one function to create a default layer stackup for static/predictable layer formats being imported, to simplify importer coding
- trace length calculator:
	- click a line or arc or via
	- start a search in two directions mapping lines, arcs and vias connected (green-highlight them, marking them found)
	- stop at the first junction (anywhere where more than 2 objects are connected)
	- stop at polygons
	- display the number of vias and net trace length along the found objects
- miter bug;  miter crosses SMT pads under certain conditions [report: celem/miloh]
