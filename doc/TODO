0. old, still waiting for ack
+ CLEANUP/feature: pcb_subc_smash_buffer() should really copy data so it can smash multiple subcs and subc objects end up on the layer they were bound to [report: keantoken]
+ FEATURE: connection check separator in log: bug_files/connreq.txt [report: keantoken]
+ FEATURE: extend the CAM job script syntax so that XY and other non-layer exporters can be called [report: celem]
+ FEATURE: extedit: when editing subc with pcb, save configuration and load it in the external pcb-rnd so that grid sizes and other settings are preserved [report: jg]
+ FEATURE: library window filter shouldn't modify filter if there's () in the string [report: pskibinski]
+ FEATURE: io_tedax: tEDAx netlist load should import and write pinname [report: Ade]
+ FEATURE: edakrill script for growing line thickness keeping the line on one side (side alignment) [report: keantoken]
+ BUG: rat rubberband bug: bug_files/anchor.lht - move the right trim subc - the internal rat conn will break; happens after {c r} too. [report: keantoken]
? BUG: parametric dialog: double click dip() in the tree; close the parametric dialog; click dip() again; edit n -> the parameter string in the filter text is ruined [report: Piotr]
+ BUG: 'pcb-rnd -x cam gerber:universal' throws excellon errors if there's no unplated hole on the design [report: bdale]
+ BUG: bug_files/slot1.lht: open as footprint for edit - no mech layers are created so slots won't display [report: cuvoodoo]
+ BUG: unit dialog in DAD coord spinbox: select a unit, global gets unchecked -> can not check global back in [report: Piotr]
+ BUG: swap_start_direction conf setting pops user out of Ortho draw after drawing a line segment. temp fix is to unset mode, but shouldn't swap_start_direction not do anything when the user is in ortho draw mode? Speeds up drawing workflow to allow this. [report: miloh]
+ BUG: property edit dialog for a subcircuit includes text 'Subcircuit' and shows the subcircuit ID# instead of parent refdes [report: Miloh] -> that is appropriate in the property editor: if goes by object ID, not refdes (note: refdes doesn't always uniquelly identify a subcircuit!); to get the UI unified, I've adde subc ID and terminal object ID in the tooltip instead.

1. For the upcoming release ===============================================================================

2. For later releases ===============================================================================
- CLEANUP: conf node split: appearance/color/cross shall be only the crosshair color; DRC highlight should use a separate node [report: Majenko]
- CLEANUP: actions must get (hidlib *) in some way that doesn't ruin compatibility - remove TODO("#hl1:...") [report: Igor2]
- CLEANUP/BUG: globalconst.h: PCB_MIN_LINESIZE shall be 1 but rather remove it alltogether; revise other minimums as well and rather update the coord spin DAD to make the limit or maybe use a double-to-coord macro that checks 0..maxcoord (or -maxcoord..maxcoord for some cases) ml:3351 [report: Majenko]
- CLEANUP: pcb_term_add() and pcb_term_del() should not be called from undo code but from attribute change callback [report: Majenko]
- CLEANUP: (TT) propedit revamp:
	- test under lesstif
	- CLEANUP: remove Attrbute() and pcb_act_Attributes -> remove; this should be handled by the property editor when lesstif already supports it.
	- CLEANUP: after the attribute dialog, remove the label argument from the DAD API [report: igor2]
	- CLEANUP: remove attrib.o from the hidlib objects
- CLEANUP/BUG: The 'As Drawn' polygon contour is not displayed if the polygon is totally clipped out of existence even though it still exists in the layout. [report: Ade]
	-> need a new rtree that holds the polygons that have ->clipped == NULL for this purpose
- CLEANUP: think over how to handle subc selection: selecting all parts automatically is bad for propedit; bug_files/subcsel.bug [report: Wojciech]
	- BUG: adding attribute works on subc parts but deleting attribute stops after deleiting it from a subc; bug_files/subcsel.bug [report: Wojciech]
- CLEANUP: lesstif DAD support for top window docks [report: Igor2]
- CLEANUP: layer order from data
	- central code for building a list of layer groups ordered by draw from front to back (omit disabled/invisible layers)
	- rewrite both the draw_everything() and pcb_search_obj_by_location_() layer loop to use this list
- CLEANUP/BUG: undo operation while drawing a multiple segment line doesn't change segment attached to the crosshair [report:wojciechk8]
	- tool_line.c depends on pcb_undo()'s return value; can be fixed only when the old undo system is removed
- CLEANUP: move import_sch to import_sch_old and start a new, generic plugin
- CLEANUP/FEATURE: boardflip doesn't function properly with undo -- repro: open pcb-rnd, place 1206, boardflip(), { u u } removes placed part instead of boardflip   [report: Miloh]
- CLEANUP: fp_fs_search: kill anything that gets ':' separated string as path list, get a config list instead
- CLENAUP: decide about exporter policy:
	- png exports selection (even in not-as-shown), others don't
	- extend png hid attribs with a flag for this, maybe do the same for others
	- document the decision in "hacking"
- CLEANUP: rewrite layer undo; take it out from old_undo; layer del breaks on undo: can't save where it was added before. Consider the whole layer move and -1 business obsolete and rather add a separate insert and remove call?
	- BUG: add new layer in main window, pcb-rnd issues pcb_warning yet action is placed on undo stack [report: Miloh]
- CLEANUP: parent subc update:
	- inhibit mechanism to speed things up:
		- under inhibit, pcb_subc_part_changed(ps) should mark subcircuits dirty
		- when inhibit drops to zero, revisit all subcircuits that are dirty
		- get a common inhibit function for batch processing that turn on draw, poly clip and pcb_subc_part_changed inhibit
- CLEANUP: CAM: in ~2020: remove the hackish gerber layer suffix and auto-excellon in favor of CAM [report: Ade]
- FEATURE: a {c f}-like feature that doesn't flag the network but prints the net name on objects large enough [report: Majenko]
- FEATURE: library window: allow long tags and long location text to split: rich text widget
- FEATURE: netlist2: bug_files/ratside.txt optional rats constraints [report: Vuokko]
- FEATURE: thermal to undo stack. reproduce: new layout, place via, place poly around via, use thermal tool on via, {u u } undo shows thermal isn't undoable [report: miloh]
- FEATURE: new breadboard
	- FEATURE: hidlib: render pixmap
	- FEATURE: optional subc pixmaps from attributes
	- DOC: pool node on how to use pixmap for breadboading
- BUG: rat draw undo not stacking correctly -- repro: draw a rat, { u u } undo, then { c r } redraws it [report: miloh]
- FEATURE: lesstif DAD support for toggle buttons [report: Igor2]
- FEATURE: (TT) route style upgrade to prototypes:
	- BUG: set same {e s s} doesn't work on padstacks [report: Igor2]
	- BUG: padstack doesn't show drc xor shape while moving - because the whole drawing is a cheat for old vias [report: igor2]
	- replace the route style dialog box's via part
	- proto copy to buffer - a buffer with a single padstack should also serve as a prototype copy vehicle? or just import by a list from the buffer
	- load/import from buffer and file
	- CLEANUP: remove PCB_MIN_PINORVIA* PCB_DEFAULT_DRILLINGHOLE macros - nothing should use them anymore
	- add text font, update the pool node text_edit [report: Igor2]
- BUG: autorouter broke on polygons: bug_files/ara.lht, {a r a}, bisect; broke before r14572 [report: Igor2]
- FEATURE: parametric footprint: bool parameter should display as checkbox in the library/parametric window [report: Majenko]
- FEATURE: fontsel: ttf import?
- FEATURE/BUG: bug_files/lines - remove zero length objects if they are created as the result of rubber banding [report: Evan]
- FEATURE: view list: import sch. shouldn't select elements to be removed but put them on a drc list
- FEATURE: drc preview: follow board flips (should be a DAD preview flag) [report: Igor2]
- FEATURE: DOC: new examples
	- blinking led with parametric footprints
	- example of nonetlist: 1206 jumpers and logos
- feature plugins:
	- FEATURE: autocrop doesnt undo (new layout, add some -maskmanaul content, autocrop(), & undo: gui view shifts, board size unchanged [report: Miloh]
	- BUG: distalign pcb_crosshair option doesn't work as a reference point  [report:Miloh]
- FEATURE: padstack bbox:
	- per layer: keep a bbox per transformed shape per prototype, then getting the bbox of a padstack ref on a specific layer is looking up the shape, then 4 integer additions [report: Wojciech]
	- when calculating overall padstack bbox, ignore layers that are not present? but then a layer change would require a recalc (but this is true for subcs too!) [report: Wojciech]
- XOR rendering upgrade:
		- experiment with 'emboss' kind of drawing instead of xor so rendering can stay 'direct'
		- if worked: allow padstack xor draw to draw all shapes on all layers
- export_dsn/new io_dsn (with King Kevin and celem):
	- missing global padstack (via) export:
		- FEATURE: need to think over and check the spec for how to do this with no-hole padstacks
		- RTT tests: thermal_layer.dsn, comp1.dsn, padstack.dsn
	- BUG: elem_pads_ds: do not export line shape in padstacks as polygons, that kills round cap lines
- FEATURE: draw on move: 'Crosshair shows DRC clearance' should show the clearance also when moving a ... (not only when placing it) [report: wojciechk8]
	- need to precalculate and cache clearance shape in crosshair (polyarea!) because recalculating these for padstacks would be expensive (also rewrite lines and arcs)
	- padstack
	- clearing polygon
	- text
- FEATURE: key rewrite: (base key swap bug (q<->a, y<->z))
	- for <char> (punctuation): learn key for non-US users
	- lesstif code upgrade for the new API
	- menu file fixup on punctuation in lesstif
- FEATURE: undo on new layer from right-click menu in gtk layersel doesn't work
- FEATURE: layersel: consider to provide a config setting for making open-group-name horizontal [report: istankovic]
- FEATURE: preview widget: allow to handle keys both in gtk and lesstif
- FEATURE: {v n} on subc should set subc PCB_FLAG_TERMNAME too; when more terminals are created (named) within the subc, they should inherit the subc's PCB_FLAG_TERMNAME flag (probably in the attribute change callback) [report: Majenko]
- res/menu:
	- FEATURE: load/swap menus (TODO#1)
	- CLEANUP: search for vendor in the hid plugins, there should be no trace of it (vendor should register its in submenus with anchors)
	- FEATURE: fungw: auto-remove menus by cookie (TODO#2)
	- FEATURE: load new res on the fly (replace the menu system):
		- low level reload code (re-add the dynamic menus too!)
		- action to reload if file name is known
		- gui load dialog with tags listed
- FEATURE: project specific menus from extra lihata files - maybe from project.lht
- BUG: Lihata persistent save:
	- flag compatibility: save unknown, string-flags as loaded by io_pcb
	- ind: FONTS: second font indents incorrectly
	- ind: indentation bug in inline struct therm: closing } is preceded by indentation whitespace for some reason
	- keep numeric format: test all
	- keep unknown subtrees
	- doc/user/02_model/src/obj_arc.lht: Open/Save : Font section is embedded. Once manually removed, the file shows many diffs w.r.t original. Lihata V1 file.
	- BUG: lhtpers indentation: bug_files/lhtpers_ins/; breakpoint in pers_table.c:34 and debug why the newline is getting in [report: Igor2]
- query & advanced search
	- FEATURE: search expr wizard should pick up the expression from the button when clicked
	- CLEANUP: make a run on a large board, speed test, with -O0 and -O3:
		- iteration speed (a simple @)
		- eval speed (a simple @ with a lot of constants in an expr)
		- geo speed
		- regex and string cmp match speed vs. select by name
- FEATURE: holes should be drawn below silk and mask - this could be a config setting
- BUG: I/O bugs:
	- eagle:
		- BUG: eagle binary library load fails with assert when pad dimension == 0, drill != zero. Bug arises from uninitiliased st.ms_width minimum feature width DRC value. This does not manifest in XML load as it initiliased to default value of 10mil before the DRC block is read, and updated if specified in the DRC block. There is no DRC block in an eagle binary library, so a decision has to be made wrt to where a default minimum feature size is to be referred to, so that the pad/hole reading code can apply it when pad dimension is not specified at line 824 in read.c. If dimension is not present, but drill is, read.c correctly applies the DRC derived rv_pad_top at line 818 dia = eagle_get_attrc(st, subtree, "diameter", drill * (1.0+st->rv_pad_top*2.0)); Planned changes to rectangle parsing to geenrate copper rectangles, not four lines, will alter +/- eliminate the need for the rectangle read routine to have ms_width available pre DRC read. See bug_files/e-motoren.lbr. [report: Erich]
		- BUG: text rotations not quite right in eagle binary format layouts. See bug_files/tvbgone3-brd-in-eagle.png. Seems 180 and 270ccw rotation are rendered as upright an 90ccw rotation. Hmm. [erich]
		- BUG: valgrind shows memory leaks relating to binary load. See bug_files/e-motoren.lbr [report: erich]
		- BUG: on loading bug_files/diode.lbr, pcb-rnd's clipping polygon out of existence routine seems to go into a non terminating loop [report: erich]
		- layers for top and bottom soldermask, if not present in loaded eagle file, i.e. tvbgone3.brd, do not export on creating gerbers, and cannot be added easily to layout via layer prefs, since ability to add a soldermask group is lacking [erich].
		- eagle XML import fails on polygon import reported by miloh, test file alien_formats/eagle/OSHW_XML_examples/eagle_polygon_crash.brd [report: erich], due to input file containing an invalid polygon: a self intersecting poly in line 156 - consider handling "width"?
		- eagle rectangle parsing should generate a rectangular feature, not a four line rectangular outline [erich]
		- eagle XML wire elements need to have "curve" attribute processed, if present. i.e. arcs. Can see translate2geda for hints [report: erich]
		- eagle binary format appended text block needs to be parsed and the text strings allocated to ASCII-127 references in preceding text blocks [erich] 
		- eagle binary format v3 and libraries do not have a DRC block specifying restring or minimum feature widths. Binary loader should add a DRC block in these cases to the tree with the minimum settings needed for padstacks and features to load sensibly. [erich].
		- bin: padstack clearances for element pins will rely on connectivity to other polygons layer by layer defined in the netlist 
		- bin: need to refine naming of library (.lbr) elements in loaded .lbr files; any text names in the binary tree, if starting with ASCII 127, sequentially reference strings in the text block which comes immediately after the board/design tree. In later eagle binary versions, the text block seems to become a node of the tree, but a node of arbitrary length, not 24 bytes, with length of block still encoded in first few bytes. 
		- bin: need to add support for non top silk (tPlace), tDocu and top copper text in read.c
		- bin: layouts, once loaded, have issue where deselection of elements only deselects element pins/pads. click-drag of element or saving the layout to .lht and reloading fixes the deselection issue. Example FTSH.... library file for a header exhibits this behaviour.
	- revise all I/O plugins for:
		- text thickness
		- text rotation
		- padstacks
		- new outline/mech layers and slots
		- new doc layers
- BUG: lesstif hbox/vbox allocation issues: test with bug_files/ltf_fillbox/ patches applied, with the fontsel action; opening it multiple times will randomly show or hide the button
	- hvbox: fontsel, about dialog: resize to smaller doesn't re-layout
	- tabbed: redisplay bug in the about box
	- re-test HPANE: pstklib(), netlistdialog(), propedit(), BrowseScripts, preferences dialog config tab
	- preferences dialog: library, layers tabs are unusable [report: Igor2]
- BUG: bug_files/rat_shortest.lht: because of "don't add non-manhattan lines" part [report: pstuge]
- BUG: find.c: unplated padtsacks shall not connect layers; bug_files/unplated1.lht; problem: a padstack is either found or not, this affects all layers, there's no info about which layer is found; padstack update should check the hole/slot geo and update a bit for each shape telling whether it's connected or not
- BUG: bug_files/rubberx.lht: move the horizontal line upward, rubber band breaks the traces (ortho mode) [report: aron]
- BUG: Rubberband move line endpoints ignores connected arc endpoints. [Fixing:Ade]
- version 3.0.0:
	- dir rename trunk/pcblib/tru-hole should handle make correctly and not walk on existing web services or user installs

3. Long term ===============================================================================
- BUG: gtk2_gl: RTT/arc_sizes.lht - elliptical arc corner case render bug [report: Wed]
- BUG: bug_files/pstk_offs.lht - most of the code gets confused if a padstack's shape is far away from the padstack origin; try {c r} or {c f} on R8-1 [report: igor2]
- FEATURE: "thermal recipe" so a padstack thermal can be put in a padstack or subc and it is change with the layer binding [report: jg]
- CLEANUP: layer group rewrite: remove PCB_MAX_LAYERGRP and PCB_MAX_LAYER and make them dynamic
- FEATURE: layer binding dialog: manual layer binding (reuse csect?)
- CLEANUP: reduce
		- export_bom: rewrite the string list code using htsp and/or lists
		- hash in hid_attrib.c?
		- gcode invents .png name locally
		- get rid of gcode/lists.h,  and vector.[ch] (autorouter)
		- vendordrill
			- search for /units, replace it with pcb-printf something
			- add round down
			- replace ignore_refdes, ignore_value and ignore_descr with genvector
- vendor drill plugin:
	- CLEANUP: check if we want to keep vendor name
	- FEATURE: vendor: be able to load multiple vendor files (project spec for skips, central for vendor) [report: celem]
- FEATURE: lesstif: implement/enable local grid in lesstif (menu option is disabled)
- FEATURE: lihata v7
	- FEATURE: data model: object minimal clearance value from the polygon side; final clearance should be MAX(obj->Clearance, poly->Clearance); kicad example: 1 line, 2 polygons with 2 different clearance values - see CUCP#38 provided by Karl [report: Igor2]
	- remove via geometry from route style
	- remove netlist net ->style, should be a plain attribute (but keep the dedicated field in old versions)
	- save and load rat anchor object idpath
	- poly side clearance value (complements object's clearance) when it is introduced in the data model
- FEATURE: scconfig: menuconfig and a config file for scconfig

4. Low prio ===============================================================================
- FEATURE: footprint in-place replacement should match up floaters to keep their coords, as documented in ML/2304 [report: gpaubert]
- FEATURE: filled vias for via-in-pad: http://www.saturnelectronics.com/products_capabilities/via-in-pad.html
- FEATURE: depth controlled mech layers (routed) for internal cavirites: http://www.saturnelectronics.com/products_capabilities/internal-cavity_boards.html
- BUG: 1. place 0603; 2. select; 3. cut to buffer; 4. undo -> 0603 put back but selection is lost; reason: the flag is removed in the buffer, but not in an undoable way as we don't have undo on buffer [report: igor2, miloh]
- BUG?: Far-side silk text can be selected and moved when the mouse is over front-side subcircuit. (but this is what we had with elements too! -> rewrite search.c to be a 'script' config) bug_files/farsilk.lht [report: Ade]
- BUG: RTT/arc_sizes.lht - unable to move arcs which have different width and height [report: Ade] - rewrite pcb_is_point_on_arc() elliptical case at the bottom
- FEATURE: padstack label smarter print: in case of full overlap of a bottom and top "pad", arrange other-side labels to avoid overlaps [report: al3x]
- improve locking:
	- FEATURE: consider a move-only lock?
	- BUG: when thermal and some other operations are applied on a locked element, indicate it
- CLEANUP: insert drag&drop strangeness (mainline too):
	insert should just insert a new point and stop there, not starting a drag&drop
	move; the new point should be marked somehow (e.g. green-find one half of the
	object, like arc split does) lines can be inserted mostly only in all-dir-line
	which is strange
- FEATURE: display net names on pins, vias (and maybe tracks?) when zoomed in enough
- FEATURE: DRC should warn for thin poly hair
- CLEANUP: win32 port {large}
	- clean up central Makefile.in rules: remove cat, sed, grep where possible, use scconfig instead
- BUG: arc bug: draw an arc with one end out of the drawing area; it will be jumpy and can not be placed properly
	-> AttachForCopy() calls SetCrosshairRange() that then sets crosshair max* which
	- similar with lines: bug_files/dwgarea.lht; grabbing the lines for move will force them to fall within the drawing area [report: pstuge]
	limits the arc to move freely. Problem: this is not arc-specific, this happens with any buffer copy! going for no-design-limit is probably better
	- similar issue: can't move outline lines to coord 0;0 because of line width.[report: pstuge]
- FEATURE: while drawing a line, the temporary outline should reflect the layer color
- FEATURE: trace length calculator:
	- click a line or arc or via
	- start a search in two directions mapping lines, arcs and vias connected (green-highlight them, marking them found)
	- stop at the first junction (anywhere where more than 2 objects are connected)
	- stop at polygons
	- display the number of vias and net trace length along the found objects
- FEATURE: revise the importer; http://repo.hu/cgi-bin/pool.cgi?cmd=show&node=make_import ; should work without an existing file [report: TwisteR]
- FEATURE: io_pcb: new, optional "layer tag" field in mainline's file format
