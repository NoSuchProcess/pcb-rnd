<H1> Had to convert import:: attributes to import_sch config </H1>

<H2> What it is </H2>
<p>
The old schematics import code used board attributes to remember the name
of the schematics files and method of import. These attributes had names
starting with <i>import::</i>.
<p>
The new import code does not use those attributes to store its configuration
but uses the configuration subtree <i>plugins/import_sch</i>. The names
and meaning of the settings changed too.
<p>
This error message is generated once, when you first run import schematics
using the new code on a board file that still has the old, attribute based
configuration. By the time the error message is printed, the code has already
converted the old attributes to the new config.

<H2> What you need to do </H2>
<p>
Normally: nothing.
<p>
There is only one special case: if you plan to use the same board file with
older versions of pcb-rnd in parallel to a new version of pcb-rnd <b>and</b>
you have to change the import configuration on any version, you will also need
to do the same changes on the other version. This is because the new code
will change only the import_sch config version, while the old code will change
only the attributes.
