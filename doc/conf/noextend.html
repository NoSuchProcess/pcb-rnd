<H1> The OLD config system in pcb-rnd </H1>
<H2> If the config system is too static </H2>

This document describes the old situation, focusing on drawbacks for
a purpose: to give a hint on why some of the design decisions are made
the way they are, in the new conf system.

<h3> Settings, preferences, colors, and... </h3>
The core implemented a so called Settings. It was a flat list of items,
each bound to a C variable. There was a bunch of metadata attached to
the items: name, type, description. Generic code could query or change
the value of any setting, the C code could read and write them directly
too. The content is saved to ~/.pcb/settings.
<p>
On the downside, the actual items this system knew about was pretty much
static, hardwired in core. A plugin could not register its own settings.
Multiple parallel methods were present in the code to overcome this
limitation:
<ul>
	<li> HID attributes: another way to describe name-type-metadata lists; this
	was used to pass on some rc-like parameters to the GUI HIDs. It's also the
	main API to describe export parameters for the export HIDs. However,
	HID attributes is not well suited for saving plugin (or HID) user
	preferences, it is more about a per action configuration.

	<li> The gtk HID also saved its own settings to a separate file called
	~/.pcb/preferences.

	<li> Some gtk HID settings didn't quiet fit in the preferences - the color
	scheme can be saved in another file, usually under ~/.pcb/colors

	<li> A random plugin could either use the HID attributes to get a limited
	service or like the gtk HID did, had to implement its own save-restore of
	persistent settings.
</ul>

<h3> Meta-drawbacks </h3>
This also introduced a more subtle drawback: the configuration was now
scattered into different files, <i>randomly</i> (looking from the
user's point of view). In other words, the actual structure did not reflect
some logical grouping, but mostly historical or source code organizational
reasons.
<p>
In turn, this also limited (again somewhat randomly) what settings can be
stored system-wise, user-wise, or on project or design level.
<p>
Finally, handling of file search paths was not very sophisticated. There
was the system and user configuration that reflected where the stock
library or the user's generic library were installed.  And then
there was the per-project local footprint libs that had to be somehow
added too.
<p>
There was a hardwired way of handling the situation where multiple set
of paths were specified. In practice it was usually possible to get this
to work for the simpler cases, but it was not powerful enough to express
things like "use all system and user libraries first, then the project's local
library" vs. "the project's local library has priority over system libraries".
