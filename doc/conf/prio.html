<H1> The new config system in pcb-rnd </H1>
<H2> Priorities </H2>

Priority is an integer property of each config root.
<a href="syntax.html">Syntax-wise</a> it is part of the name of the config
root. In the lihata config file it is either specified or omitted. When
omitted,  <a href="sources.html"> a role dependent default value</a> is
used. The default values are chosen in an intuitive way, thus most
commonly the priority value is omitted.
<p>
For <a href="scalars.html">scalar</a> settings, the highest priority
value determines the final value of a setting after the merge. If there
is a tie, role decides: the role closer to the CLI is stronger.
<p>
For <a href="lists.html">lists</a> and arrays, priority determines the
order of merge, which changes the order of itmes in the final list as
config roots prepend and append items.
