<h1> pcb-rnd - privacy policy </h1>
<p>
By using any service provided at repo.hu, you agree to this privacy policy.

<h2> Mailing list </h2>
<p>
You can subscribe to the mailing list by sending a mail to it with that
contains the word <i>subscribe</i> in the subject or in the message.
<p>
To unsubscribe:
<ul>
	<li> send a mail that contains the word <i>unsubscribe</i> in the subject
	     or in the message to the list (note: this mail will be public to
	     inform other users that you are unsubscribing)
	<li> or send a similar mail to <a href="contact.html">the project admin</a>
	     (in this case the mailing list won't be notified about the unsubscription)
</ul>
<p>
Note: (un)subscriptions are handled manually and may take anything between
hours and days to get done.
<p>
The mailing list software running at list.repo.hu will store your email address
as long as you are subscribed. This address is used only for receiving
mails you send to the list and deliver mail from the list to you. Other
pcb-rnd users and developers subscribed to the mailing list may use
this email address to contact you privately about topics related to
pcb-rnd - these are private emails, outside of the scope of this privacy
policy.
<p>
The mailing list has a publicly accessible archive; anything you post
will be published there. In the published mailing list archives most of
the email headers in the mailing list are hidden or masked, but the body
(content) of the email is not necessarily masked.
<p>
If you do not want your content to be entered in the public mailing list
archive, do not post to the mailing list.
<p>
Using the mailing list or the list archives for harvesting email addresses
and/or sending advertisements to those addresses is strictly prohibited.

<h2> Bugreports in private mail </h2>
<p>
Developers may accept pcb-rnd bugreports at their private email boxes. Since
these mail are private, person-to-person mail, this privacy policy does not
cover them, only common sense applies. Before sending anything confidential,
e.g. board files, agree with the developer how he may handle the data.


<h2> IRC </h2>
<p>
No registration is required for using the IRC network at repo.hu. Your
visible identification, as per the IRC protocol, will include:
<ul>
	<li> your nickname (that you can choose)
	<li> your 'ident' (which is either served to the IRC server by your ident server or is a string chosen by you)
	<li> your IP address or host name, as seen by the IRC server (if you are using the kiwi-irc webchat service, your IP will be encoded in your 'ident')
	<li> your 'real name' field, as specified by you (does not have to be your real name).
</ul>
<p>
IRC channels on the repo.hu irc network are generally public. Any user
may log, quote or publish channel traffic. For some of the channels,
e.g. #pcb-rnd, the server publishes logs automatically.
The above data, with time stamps, is also visible in public irc logs.

<h2> Running pcb-rnd </h2>
<p>
Running pcb-rnd does not require any registration. The software does
not try to handle personal data in any way (except when you enter
such data as arbitrary text strings, typically to be part of your
design data). Pcb-rnd does not send your design data over the network, unless
you explicitly command it to do so (e.g. saving to a network file system).
<p>
When configured so by the user, pcb-rnd may anonymously download files
from remote data repositories, such as edakrill or gedasymbols. These
sites may log your IP address and your request, according to their
privacy policy.

<h2> Writing source code, svn write access </h2>
<p>
To gain write access to svn, you will need to choose a publicly visible
user name. It is not possible to change that user name later. Once you
commit, your user name, commit message, the diff you commited and the date
all become part of the repository history. It is not possible to remove this
data from the repository history later.
<p>
The lead developer grants svn write access. The lead developer may require that
you reveal your real name and electronic contact info to the lead developer
and/or to the audience. This is mainly required for copyright and communication
reasons. It is normally not possible to contribute code or svn diffs
anonymously and/or without letting pcb-rnd users and developers contact you.
<p>
If you make substantial change to files with copyright banner, coordinated
with the lead developer, you may choose to add your copyright to that banner.
If you do so, the copyright year and your real name will become part of that
source file, normally part of the source distribution and the repository
history and will be dupped into an uncontrollable amount of publicly accessible
copies (most often outside of repo.hu).
<p>
In other words, because of the nature of the technology being used
(version control, software distribution, packaging), if anything enters
the repository history, it is practically impossible to remove it from
publicly accessible material later.
