1. Action scripting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Action scripting is the builtin, non-turing-complete way of giving pcb-rnd
commands. On the GUI it's usually the ':' key that pops up the command line.
Most HIDs support the --listen argument that makes pcb-rnd also read commands
on the stdin.

The batch HID always reads commands on stdin (without --listen). Automated
pcb-rnd runs from shell is possible using a script like:

echo '
	action1()
	action2()
	...
' | pcb-rnd --gui batch


2. Embedded scripting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pcb-rnd uses fungw for embedded scripting. This allows pcb-rnd to be
scripted in 10+ turing complete scripting languages, including awk, tcl,
python, perl, lua, some lisp dialects, etc. Embedded scripts run within
pcb-rnd (in the same process, same address space), having full access
to the action infrastructure:
 - embedded scripts can declare new actions that are accessible from
   menu, from the command line and from other embedded scripts
 - embedded scripts can execute actions (defined by pcb-rnd or other
   embedded scripts)

For more info see user/06_feature/scripting/

Usage

 Run action

  LoadScript(id, filename, language)

 where id is an arbitrary text ID. The ID is used for referencing the script
 once it is loaded. The filename should be a full path (CWD is pcb-rnd's
 CWD). Language must be one of the languages configured in step 2 above.

 Once the script is loaded, it is accessible by calling the actions it
 registered using the standard fgw_func_reg() mechanism.

 Scripts can be unloaded using the action

  UnloadScript(id)
