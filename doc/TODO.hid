HID API simplification: DAD

- blockers:
	- implementing a list/tree/table "widget" for lesstif
	- implementing and testing the PCB_HATT_TREE in gtk
	- implementing and testing the PCB_HATT_TREE in lesstif
	- implement and test a new text/log entry HATT (API not yet specified) in lesstif
	- implement and test a new text/log entry HATT (API not yet specified) in gtk

- DAD conversion:
	- rewriting the route style dialog as DAD
	- write a DAD based confirm window for fallback
	- rewrite the user input window as DAD
	- rewrite the log dialog (depends on the text/log HATT)
	(- rewrite the pinout dialog as DAD (depends on a preview HATT, which is a bigger chunk))
	- rewrite the report dialog as DAD

HID API simplification: actions

- obsolete actions to remove/revise:
	- lesstif: AdjustStyle (lesstif has its own window!)
	- lesstif: LesstifNetlistShow

- action unification:
	- Zoom
		- also impelment zoom get
	- Scroll is only in the gtk hid
	- Popup is gtk only
