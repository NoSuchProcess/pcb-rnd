Active user wishes:
	W2: proper primitives [Chris]
	W4: user doc [Miloh]
	W7: programmable drc (star grounding) [James]
	W9: push & shove [Erich, Evan]

Being done:
	W1: cschem [Chris]
	W3: more generic footprints [Chris, Evan] -> subcircuits
	W5: 3d modeller export [Miloh, Evan] (bdale's sponsoration)

User wishes fulfilled:
	W6:  GUI access to object attributes: gtk editor, find/select by attrib [James]
	W8: gl support [Erich, Evan]

Plan (parallel threads of development):

	A. file format and model
		Steps:
			1. (done) lihata persistency
			2. (done) native lihata file format
			3. (done) extend the file format
				- everything should have an attribute hash -> W6
				- footprints should have optional attachments (e.g. 3d models) -> W5
		This helps us testing out the persistent-lihata idea that'd be
		later used in cschem from the start -> W1
		This is also needed for more generic footprint implementation -> W3

	B. visible attribute support
		Steps:
			1. (done) GTK dialog box for attribute edition
			2. (done) search & select should work by attribute
			3. (done) extend the routing style system to auto-add attributes
			   (this needs A., the new file format)
		Allows the user to manage properties like "50 ohm net" in attributes,
		to group objects by property, and to select them by property. -> W6
