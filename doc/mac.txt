State on MacOSX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source releases starting from 1.1.0 should compile and run out-of-the-box.

Requirements for GUI:  x11 and gtk+
  - X11 server and client libraries for OS X are available from the XQuartz 
     download and install
  - gtk+ is available from brew
     * brew install dependencies (gtk+ and libgd) with the following commands
       brew install libgd
       brew install gtk+
       brew install pkg-config
     * if you want to use gEDA with PCB-RND you may want to install it as well
       via brew
       brew install homebrew/science/geda-gaf

Known issues:
  - application window opens behind other windows; it seems to be a gtk bug
    that can not be worked around from the application
  - slow rendering and error messages about invalid numerics on the console

Considerations listed in ../INSTALL apply.

pcb-rnd is reported to work at least on the following versions:

macOS               xquartz
