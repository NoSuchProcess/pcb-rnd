State on windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Does not work yet but there has been a breakthrough recently.

1. download the binary pack and install

2. limitations

pcb-rnd is a package designed for UNIX. The windows port does not
change the UNIX aspect of pcb-rnd, thus a few things are different from
a normal windows application:
 - pcb-rnd works from config files, not from the registry
 - pcb-rnd will figure the users home directory and will look for .pcb-rnd/
   in there for the user configs
 - if anything breaks, try to run pcb-rnd from the command line: run a cmd.exe
   and cd to the bin dir within the installation root and run pcb-rnd from
   there watching what it prints to the console.

The usual pcb-rnd policies apply:
 - pcb-rnd speaks English - there's no internalization, no unicode or utf
 - some keyboard shortcuts may not work if your keyboard layout is not set
   to English
 - pcb-rnd uses the keyboard and the command line heavily

There are a few limitations specific to the current windows pack:
 - it does not support opengl, it is always doing software rendering
 - some of the export formats are not yet supported on windows
 - there is no fp_wget support because there's no wget in the pack
   (may work with busybox wget, busybox shipped in the pack, testing required)
 - gsch2pcb-rnd is not supported
 - import schematics with gnetlist has not been tested yet
   (importing tEDAx netlist should work)
 - the windows port may have some overhead; if you find pcb-rnd slow,
   please try it on Linux.

3. Cross compilation from Linux to win32
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(developers may need this, if you are an user, it is safe to skip.)
