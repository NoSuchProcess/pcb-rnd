.SH DECSRIPTION

.BR pcb-rnd
is a modular PCB editor. The main use is interactive editing. If no \fI-x\fR is specified on the command line, the graphical editor mode is initiated. Automated, headless processing is also possible with \fI-x\fR or \fI--gui batch\fR.
.SH OPTIONS


.TP

.B --help \fItopic\fR 
Print help about \fItopic\fR and exit; if no topic is specified, print available topics. 
.TP

.B -x \fIexporter\fR [\fIexportflags] \fIinputfile\fR\fR 
Instead of interactive editing, export the design (loaded from \fIinputfile\fR) to a file using the specified \fIexporter\fR plugin. A list of exporter-specific parameters may follow to control the details of the process. 
.TP

.B --gui \fIhid\fR 
Use the \fIhid\fR plugin for the "gui" frontend. Common choices are "gtk" or "lesstif" for graphical user interfaces and "batch" for a headless command-line interface (or automated batch processing). 
.TP

.B -c \fIpath=val\fR 
Set a config node in role CFR_CLI. The path of the node is \fIpath\fR (e.g. editor/grid) and the new value is \fIval\fR (e.g. 5mm).
