<name> pcb-rnd-svg - compare pcb-rnd svg renders </name>
<syn> <call>pcb-rnd-svg</call> command [<arg>args</arg>] </syn>
<description>
<call>pcb-rnd-svg</call> compares svg renders generated by pcb-rnd in a way
that order of objects within the svg does not matter, only layering and
geometry do. This is done by sorting group objects, assuming each object
is a single line.
<p>
Note: stored reference files are of format boardname.ref or boardname.ref.gz
if they are compressed.

	<item>
		<key> diff b1 b2</key>
		<value> run pcb-rnd to generate svgs of b1 and b2 and print their diff;
