Manual pages are written in the manual markup format and are compiled into
manual and html using mml. Do not edit the generated manual or html pages.

The generated files are commited in the repository so dependencies are not
required for casual users to build the project.

The required tools and dependencies are:
 svn://repo.hu/libmawk/trunk
 svn://repo.hu/web3.0/trunk
 svn://repo.hu/shscripts/trunk/manmarkup
