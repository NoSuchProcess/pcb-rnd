<table border=1>

	<TR>

		<TD> -s 
		<TD> Remove symbols (the font). The pcb file stops being self-containing, pcb-rnd (or pcb) will load and apply the default font when the file is loaded. Useful for reducing the file size for test input and example files where font correctness is not required. 
	<TR>

		<TD> -a 
		<TD> Remove board attributes. Useful for deleting local configuration
