.SH NAME
fp2subc - convert any footprint into a pcb-rnd subcircuit
.SH SYNPOSIS
.nf
.sp
\fBfp2subc [\fIoptions\fB] \fIinfile\fB [\fIoutfile\fB]
.fi
.SH DECSRIPTION

.BR fp2subc
executes pcb-rnd in batch mode to load a footprint (typically specified in an alien format) and save it as a native pcb-rnd subcircuit. The script is useful for mass-converting old footprint libraries. 
.PP
If \fIoutfile\fR is not specified, its name is guessed from \fIinfile\fR
.SH OPTIONS


.TP

.B --lib 
\fIinfile\fR is not a path but a footprint name that should be searched in the library 
.TP

.B -l 
same as --lib 
.TP

.B --pcb-rnd exepath 
run exepath for invoking pcb-rnd (default is "pcb-rnd", which depends on $PATH) 
.TP

.B -p exepath 
same as --pcb-rnd 
.TP

.B --debugger exepath 
insert exepath before pcb-rnd on the command line; useful for running the process e.g. in valgrind 
.TP

.B -d exepath 
same as --debugger 
.TP

.B -c key=val 
pass on a -c key=val CLI config setting to pcb-rnd; useful for setting up library paths
