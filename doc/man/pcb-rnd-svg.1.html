<blockquote>
<P>
<tt><B>pcb-rnd-svg</B> command [<I>args</I>]</tt>



</blockquote>

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<blockquote>
<B>pcb-rnd-svg</B> compares svg renders generated by pcb-rnd in a way that order of objects within the svg does not matter, only layering and geometry do. This is done by sorting group objects, assuming each object is a single line.
</blockquote>

	<TR>

		<TD> test brd
