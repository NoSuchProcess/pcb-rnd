<H3>NAME</H3>
<blockquote>
pcb-rnd-svg - compare pcb-rnd svg renders
</blockquote>

<H3>SYNPOSIS</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>
<tt><B>pcb-rnd-svg</B> command [<I>args</I>]</tt>



</blockquote>

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<blockquote>
<B>pcb-rnd-svg</B> compares svg renders generated by pcb-rnd in a way that order of objects within the svg does not matter, only layering and geometry do. This is done by sorting group objects, assuming each object is a single line. 
<P>
Note: stored reference files are of format boardname.ref or boardname.ref.gz if they are compressed.

</blockquote>


<H3>OPTIONS</H3>
<blockquote>

<table border=1>

	<TR>

		<TD> svg-sort 
		<TD> reads a pcb-rnd generated svg on stdin, prints sorted svg: objects within each group sorted alphabetically 
	<TR>

		<TD> svg-diff s1 s2 
		<TD> sort pcb-rnd generated svgs s1 and s2 and print diff s1 s2; result written to stdout in diff -u format 
	<TR>

		<TD> diff b1 b2 
		<TD> run pcb-rnd to generate svgs of b1 and b2 and print their diff; result written to stdout in diff -u format. Boards can be of any format pcb-rnd can load. 
	<TR>

		<TD> svg-vis-comp s1 s2 
		<TD> generate a visual comparison of s1 and s2, diffs highlighted: - lines of the diff with blue, + lines with red in a new group, over the faded version of s1. 
	<TR>

		<TD> vis-comp b1 b2 
		<TD> generate a svg visual comparison of board files b1 and b2, diffs highlighted: - lines of the diff with blue, + lines with red in a new group, over the faded svg render of b1. Boards can be of any format pcb-rnd can load. 
	<TR>

		<TD> test brd 
		<TD> run pcb-rnd on brd and compare the resulting svg to a saved sorted svg reference file called brd.ref 
	<TR>

		<TD> test-all dir1 [dir2 dirN...] 
		<TD> run test on all boards with a ref available under all directories listed, recursively. 
	<TR>

		<TD> gen-ref brd1 [brd2 brdN...] 
		<TD> generate the initial svg reference file for all board files named
