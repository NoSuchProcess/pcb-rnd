<H3>NAME</H3>
<blockquote>
fp2anim - convert a gEDA/PCB footprint to animator script
</blockquote>

<H3>SYNPOSIS</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>
<tt><B>fp2anim</B> [<I>options</I>] [<I>inputfile</I>]</tt>



</blockquote>

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<blockquote>
<B>fp2anim</B> converts a footprint to a script that can be run through animator(1). It's main use is to have a automated, light-weight footprint preview generator on hosts where installing pcb-rnd would be too expensive (e.g. on web servers). 
<P>
If <I>inputfile</I> is not specified, <B>fp2anim</B> reads its STDIN for the footprint.

<H3>OPTIONS</H3>
<blockquote>

<table border=1>

	<TR>

		<TD> --grid unit 
		<TD> set grid unit e.g. to mm or mil 
	<TR>

		<TD> -g unit 
		<TD> same as --grid 
	<TR>

		<TD> --mm 
		<TD> use an mm grid instead of a mil grid; shorthand for -g mm 
	<TR>

		<TD> --diamond 
		<TD> draw a small diamond to mark at footprint origin 
	<TR>

		<TD> --annotation types 
		<TD> turn on annotation types; types is a string that may consist "pins" for pin numbers, "dimname" and "dimvalue" for dimension names and values and "background" for drawing a background under annotation text
