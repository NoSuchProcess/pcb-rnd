<h2> 9.4 Layer colors</h2>
<p>
Each layer has its own layer color. Starting with lihata board v5, the
layer color is saved to and loaded from board files. Layers retrain their
color even when they are moved within or between layer groups.
<p>
In parallel to this mechanism, there is a set of <i>default</i> colors
defined in the conf subsystem: a set of default copper layer colors and
specific default colors for paste, mask and silk layers.
<p>
There are only two cases when the default colors from the config subsystem
are used:
<ul>
<li>
When a new layer is created or a layer without color specified is loaded
from a file or when a layer is loaded from a file format that does not
support per layer color, a default color is assigned from the config,
depending on the layer type. 

<li>
When an object needs to be displayed out of the board, e.g. in the footprint
preview window of the library dialog
</ul>
<p>
Composite rendering: positive layers are always rendered using their own
layer color (e.g. it is possible to define two silk layers in the top silk
group with two different colors, and the silk drawing on screen will have
two colors). A negative layer's color is normally invisible, thus does not
matter, because objects of a negative layer are removing pixels, not drawing
them.
<p>
When a composite layer group is rendered with the first layer being negative
(typical for mask), the rendering code needs to apply a fill that covers
the whole board, so the negative layer objects can cut out from that fill. The
color of this fill is the color of the first layer.
