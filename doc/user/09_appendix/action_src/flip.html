Note that the location of the subcircuit will be symmetric about the
cursor location; i.e. if the part you are pointing at will still be at
the same spot once the subcircuit is on the other side.  When flipping
multiple subcircuits, this retains their positions relative to each
other, not their absolute positions on the board.
