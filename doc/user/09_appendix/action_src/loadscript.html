<arg>id</arg> is an arbitrary string assigned by the user. <arg>id</arg>
must be unique per pcb-rnd session per script and may contain alphanumeric characters
and undescrore.
<p>
<arg>fn</arg> is the file name of the script, which is a path. Pcb-rnd does not
do any search, it only opens the path as specified.
<p>
<arg>lang</arg> is the scripting language, as in 
<a href="http://repo.hu/projects/fungw/lang.html">fungw plugin name</a>.
When not specified, the code makes a guess (based on the file name).
