The "mark" is a small X-shaped target on the display which is
treated like a second origin (the normal origin is the upper let
corner of the board).  The GUI will display a second set of
coordinates for this mark, which tells you how far you are from it.
<p>
If no argument is given, the mark is toggled - disabled if it was
enabled, or enabled at the current cursor position of disabled.  If
the <arg>Center</arg> argument is given, the mark is moved to the current
cursor location.
