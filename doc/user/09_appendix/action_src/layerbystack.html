First argument determines what to perform.

When first argument is <arg>select</arg>, the second argument is either
<arg>prev</arg> or <arg>next</arg> and the previous or next layer on the layer
stack is selected. Note: layers are displayed in the layer stack order in
the layer selector widget (normally on the left side of the main window) so
prev/next is stepping up/down on that list.
