The unlimited undo feature of pcb-rnd allows you to recover from
most operations that materially affect you work.  Calling
<act>pcb_undo</act> without any parameter recovers from the last (non-undo)
operation. <arg>ClearList</arg> is used to release the allocated
memory. <arg>ClearList</arg> is called whenever a new layout is started or
loaded. See also <act>Redo</act>.
<p>
Note that undo groups operations by serial number; changes with the
same serial number will be undone (or redone) as a group.  See
<act>Atomic</act>.
<p>
The following arguments are intended for scripting:
<ul>
	<li> FreezeSerial: stop increasing the undo serial number
	<li> UnFreezeSerial: stop increasing the undo serial number
	<li> IncSerial: increase the undo serial number (operations with the same serial number are batched); a typical sequence for batching operations is: Undo(FreezeSerial); ...; Undo(UnFreezeSerial); Undo(IcSerial)
	<li> GetSerial: return the current undo serial
	<li> GetNum: return the number of undo slots currently allocated
	<li> Above, sernum: perform undo of all operations with serial number higher than sernum
</ul>
