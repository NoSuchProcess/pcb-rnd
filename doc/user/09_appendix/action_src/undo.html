The unlimited undo feature of pcb-rnd allows you to recover from
most operations that materially affect you work.  Calling
<act>pcb_undo</act> without any parameter recovers from the last (non-undo)
operation. <arg>ClearList</arg> is used to release the allocated
memory. <arg>ClearList</arg> is called whenever a new layout is started or
loaded. See also <act>Redo</act>.
<p>
Note that undo groups operations by serial number; changes with the
same serial number will be undone (or redone) as a group.  See
<act>Atomic</act>.
