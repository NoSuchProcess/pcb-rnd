First argument:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr><th> AllRats
	<td> Create rat lines for all loaded nets that aren't already connected on
	     with copper.

	<tr><th> SelectedRats
	<td> Similarly, but only add rat lines for nets connected to selected pins
	     and pads.

	<tr><th> Close
	<td> Selects the shortest unselected rat on the board.
</table>
<p>
The second argument is temporary and optional, for a workaround of a bug in
the old (to be removed) autorouter. If the value of the second argument is
"manhattan", non-axis-aligned lines are ignored when looking for rat anchor
points.
