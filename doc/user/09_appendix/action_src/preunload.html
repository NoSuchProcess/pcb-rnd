<act>preunload</act> is an optional action scripts may provide. When present,
it is called by pcb-rnd as the last call to the script before the script is
unloaded. It has two purposes:
<ul>
	<li> give scripts a chance to clean up, uninit and unregister
	<li> give scripts a chance to perist their state
</ul>
<p>
State persisting is achieved through returning a string from this action. That
string is then saved by pcb-rnd under the scripts' load ID (as specified by
the user). In a later script load, the script with the same ID may read the
persistent data frolm disk using the <act>ScriptPersistency</act>(read) action
and can remove the save using the <act>ScriptPersistency</act>(remove) action.
<p>
<b>It should never be called by the user or other code or other actions.</b>
