Useful when multiple subcircuits should be saved to be reused as a library.
When first argument is <b>dir</b>, each subcircuit is saved in a separate, numbered
file. If the first argument is <b>file</b> and the target file format has
library support, all subcircuits are saved in the same file, as a library.
<p>
If a single subcircuit from buffer needs to be saved to be a footprint,
use the <act>SaveTo</act> action with first argument set to PasteBuffer.
