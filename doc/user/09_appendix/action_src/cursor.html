This action moves the mouse cursor.  Unlike other actions which take
coordinates, this action's coordinates are always relative to the
user's view of the board.  Thus, a positive <arg>DeltaUp</arg> may move the
cursor away from the board origin if the board is inverted (flipped,
looked from the bottom).
<p>
<arg>Type</arg> is one of <i>Pan</i> or <i>Warp</i>. <i>Pan</i> causes the
viewport to move such that the crosshair is under the mouse cursor.
<i>Warp</i> causes the mouse cursor to move to be above the crosshair.
<p>
<arg>Units</arg> can be one of the following:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr><td>mil<br>mm
	<td>The cursor is moved by that amount, in board units.

	<tr><td>grid
	<td>The cursor is moved by that many grid points.

	<tr><td>view
	<td>The values are percentages of the viewport's view. Thus, a pan of
	    <i>100</i> would scroll the viewport by exactly the width of the current view.


	<tr><td>board
	<td> The values are percentages of the board size. Thus, a move of
	     <i>50,50</i> moves you halfway across the board.
