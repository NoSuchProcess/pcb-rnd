The ClaimNet() action can be used to construct network metadata
(netlist entry) converting existing physical (galvanic, copper) connections
or object lists.
<p>
When galvanic connections are mapped, the first argument shall be <arg>object</arg>;
in this case the object under the mouse cursor is the starting point and
anything galvanically connected (at the moment) is considered part of the new
network. This mode of operation is useful for capturing existing nets.
<p>
When the first argument is <arg>selected</arg> or <arg>found</arg>, the
list of (selected or found) terminals are converted to a new net, regardless
of galvanic connections. This mode is useful for designing a PCB by a netlist
but without a schematics - in this setup the netlist is "drawn" in pcb-rnd as
well.
<p>
If <arg>netname</arg> is specified, the user is prompted for a name.
