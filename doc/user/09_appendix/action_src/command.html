The command window allows the user to manually enter actions to be
executed.
<p>
There are two ways to finish with the command window.  If you press
the <i>Enter</i> key, the command is invoked, the entry normally goes away,
and the next time you bring up the command window it's empty.  If you
press the <i>Esc</i> key, the window goes away without invoking
anything, and the next time you bring up the command window it's
empty.
<p>
Use the <i>up</i> and <i>down</i> arrow keys to access command history.
