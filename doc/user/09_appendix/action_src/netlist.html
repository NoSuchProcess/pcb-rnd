Each of these actions apply to a specified set of nets. <arg>net</arg> and
<arg>pin</arg> are patterns which match one or more nets or pins; these
patterns may be full names or regular expressions.  If an exact match
is found, it is the only match; if no exact match is found,
<b>then</b> the pattern is tried as a regular expression.
<p>
If neither <arg>net</arg> nor <arg>pin</arg> are specified, all nets apply.
If <arg>net</arg> is specified but not <arg>pin</arg>, all nets matching
<arg>net</arg> apply.  If both are specified, nets which match <arg>net</arg>
and contain a pin matching <arg>pin</arg> apply.
<p>
<arg>freeze</arg>, <arg>thaw</arg> and <arg>forcethaw</arg>
temporarily prevents changes to the netlist from being reflected in
the GUI. For example, if you need to make multiple changes, you
<arg>freeze</arg> the netlist, make the changes, then <arg>thaw</arg> it.
Note that freeze/thaw requests may nest, with the netlist being fully thawed
only when all pending freezes are thawed.  You can bypass the nesting
by using <arg>forcethaw</arg>, which resets the freeze count and immediately
updates the GUI.
