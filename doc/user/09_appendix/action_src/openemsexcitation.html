When invoked without argument or with <arg>interactive</arg> a dialog box
is presented, allowing the user to do the same operations as with the
action.
<p>
If the first argument <arg>select</arg>, further OpenEMS exports will use
the excitation named in the <arg>excitationname</arg> argument (in short:
the excitation is selected).
<p>
Arguments <arg>set</arg> and <arg>get</arg> is used to read or change an
excitation parameter named in <arg>paramname</arg>. When <arg>excitationname</arg>
is not set, they operate on the currently selected excitation. For <arg>set</arg>
the <arg>paramval</arg> argument is mandatory.
<p>
Note: the code remembers all settings for all excitements, not only the 
excitement that is currently selected. The selection and all parameters are
saved as board attributes.
