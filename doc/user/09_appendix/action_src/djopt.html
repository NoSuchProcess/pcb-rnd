The different types of optimizations change your board in order to
reduce the total trace length and via count.

Arguments:

<table border=1 cellspacing=0>

	<tr><th> debumpify
	<td> Looks for U-shaped traces that can be shortened or eliminated.

	<tr><th> unjaggy
	<td> Looks for corners which could be flipped to eliminate one or more
	     corners (i.e. jaggy lines become simpler).

	<tr><th> simple
	<td> Removing uneeded vias, replacing two or more trace segments in a row
	     with a single segment.  This is usually performed automatically after
	     other optimizations.

	<tr><th> vianudge
	<td> Looks for vias where all traces leave in the same direction.  Tries to
	     move via in that direction to eliminate one of the traces (and thus a
	     corner).

	<tr><th> viatrim
	<td> Looks for traces that go from via to via, where moving that trace to a
	     different layer eliminates one or both vias.

	<tr><th> orthopull
	<td> Looks for chains of traces all going in one direction, with more
	     traces orthogonal on one side than on the other.  Moves the chain in
	     that direction, causing a net reduction in trace length, possibly
	     eliminating traces and/or corners.

	<tr><th> splitlines
	<td> Looks for lines that pass through vias, pins, or pads, and splits them
	     into separate lines so they can be managed separately.

	<tr><th> auto
	<td> Performs the above options, repeating until no further optimizations
	     can be made.

	<tr><th> miter
	<td> Replaces 90 degree corners with a pair of 45 degree corners, to reduce
	     RF losses and trace length.
