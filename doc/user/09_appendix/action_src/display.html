<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr><th> SubcID <br> Description <br> Value
	<td>Specify the subcircuit ID template to be printed on the subcircuit layer

	<tr><th> Redraw
	<td>Redraw the whole board.

	<tr><th> ToggleAllDirections
	<td>When clear, lines can be drawn at any angle.  When set, lines are
	    restricted to multiples of 45 degrees and requested lines may be
	    broken up according to the clip setting.

	<tr><th> CycleClip
	<td>Changes the way lines are restricted to 45 degree increments. The
	    various settings are: straight only, orthogonal then angled, and angled
	    then orthogonal. If AllDirections is set, this action disables it.

	<tr><th> CycleCrosshair
	<td>Changes crosshair drawing. Crosshair may accept form of 4-ray,
	    8-ray and 12-ray cross.

	<tr><th> ToggleRubberBandMode
	<td>If set, moving an object moves all the lines attached to it too.

	<tr><th> ToggleStartDirection
	<td>If set, each time you set a point in a line, the Clip toggles between
	    orth-angle and angle-ortho.

	<tr><th> ToggleUniqueNames
	<td>If set, you will not be permitted to change the name of an element to
	    match that of another element.

	<tr><th> ToggleSnapPin
	<td>If set, pin centers and pad end points are treated as additional grid
	    points that the cursor can snap to.

	<tr><th> ToggleSnapOffGridLine
	<td>If set, snap at some sensible point along a line.

	<tr><th> ToggleHighlightOnPoint
	<td>If set, highlights lines and arcs when the crosshair is on one of their
	    two (end) points.

	<tr><th> ToggleLocalRef
	<td>If set, the mark is automatically set to the beginning of any move, so
	    you can see the relative distance you've moved.

	<tr><th> ToggleThindraw
	<td>If set, objects on the screen are drawn as outlines (lines are drawn
	    as center-lines). This lets you see line endpoints hidden under pins,
	    for example.

	<tr><th> ToggleThindrawPoly
	<td>If set, polygons on the screen are drawn as outlines.

	<tr><th> ToggleShowDRC
	<td>If set, pending objects (i.e. lines you're in the process of drawing)
	    will be drawn with an outline showing how far away from other copper
	    you need to be.

	<tr><th> ToggleLiveRoute
	<td>If set, the progress of the autorouter will be visible on the screen.

	<tr><th> ToggleAutoDRC
	<td>If set, you will not be permitted to make connections which violate
	    the current DRC and netlist settings.

	<tr><th> ToggleCheckPlanes
	<td>If set, lines and arcs aren't drawn, which usually leaves just the
	    polygons.  If you also disable all but the layer you're interested in,
	    this allows you to check for isolated regions.

	<tr><th> ToggleOrthoMove
	<td>If set, the crosshair is only allowed to move orthogonally from its
	    previous position.  I.e. you can move a subcircuit or line up, down,
	    left, or right, but not up+left or down+right.

	<tr><th> ToggleName
	<td>Selects whether the pinouts show the pin names or the pin numbers.

	<tr><th> ToggleLockNames
	<td>If set, text will ignore left mouse clicks and actions that work on
	    objects under the mouse. You can still select text with a lasso (left
	    mouse drag) and perform actions on the selection.

	<tr><th> ToggleOnlyNames
	<td>If set, only text will be sensitive for mouse clicks and actions that
	    work on objects under the mouse. You can still select other objects
	    with a lasso (left mouse drag) and perform actions on the selection.

	<tr><th> ToggleClearLine
	<td>When set, the clear-line flag causes new lines and arcs to have their
	    "clear polygons" flag set, so they won't be electrically connected
	    to any polygons they overlap.

	<tr><th> ToggleFullPoly
	<td>When set, the full-poly flag causes new polygons to have their
	    "full polygon" flag set, so all parts of them will be displayed
	    instead of only the biggest one.

	<tr><th> ToggleGrid
	<td>Resets the origin of the current grid to be wherever the crosshair is.
	    If you provide two numbers after this, the origin is set to that
	    coordinate.

	<tr><th> Grid
	<td>Toggles whether the grid is displayed or not.

	<tr><th> Pinout
	<td>Causes the pinout of the subcircuit indicated by the cursor to be
	    displayed, usually in a separate window.

	<tr><th> PinOrPadName
	<td>Toggles whether the names of terminals will be
	    displayed. If the cursor is over an subcircuit, all of its terminals
	    are affected.
