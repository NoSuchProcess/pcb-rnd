The join flag determines whether a line or arc, drawn to intersect a
polygon, electrically connects to the polygon or not.  When joined,
the line/arc is simply drawn over the polygon, making an electrical
connection.  When not joined, a gap is drawn between the line and the
polygon, insulating them from each other.
