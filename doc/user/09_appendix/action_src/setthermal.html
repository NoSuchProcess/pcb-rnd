This changes how/whether padstacks connect to any rectangle or polygon
on the current layer. The first argument can specify one object, or all
selected padstacks.
The second argument specifies the style of connection.
<p>
Thermal styles:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr><th>0
	<td> no connection,

	<tr><th>1
	<td> horizontal & vertical fingers with round edges,

	<tr><th>2
	<td> horizontal & vertical fingers with sharp edges,

	<tr><th>3
	<td> solid connection,

	<tr><th>4
	<td> invalid, do not use

	<tr><th>5
	<td> 45 degree fingers with rounded corners.

	<tr><th>6
	<td> 45 degree fingers with sharp edges,

	<tr><th>noshape
	<td> remove copper shape on layer

</table>

<p>
Padstacks may have thermals whether or not there is a polygon available
to connect with. However, they will have no visible effect until a polygon
is drawn around the padstack.
