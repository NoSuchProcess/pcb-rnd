This changes how/whether padstacks connect to any rectangle or polygon
on the current layer. The first argument can specify one object, or all
selected padstacks.
The second argument specifies the style of connection.
<p>
Thermal styles:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr><th>0
	<td> no connection,

	<tr><th>1
	<td> 45 degree fingers with sharp edges,

	<tr><th>2
	<td> horizontal & vertical fingers with sharp edges,

	<tr><th>3
	<td> solid connection,

	<tr><th>4
	<td> 45 degree fingers with rounded corners,

	<tr><th>5
	<td> horizontal & vertical fingers with rounded corners.
</table>
<p>
Padstacks may have thermals whether or not there is a polygon available
to connect with. However, they will have no visible effect until a polygon
is drawn around the padstack.
