If you pass an integer, that layer is specified by index (the first
layer is <i>1</i>, etc).  If you pass a layer name, that layer is
specified by name.  When a layer is specified, the visibility of the
layer group containing that layer is toggled.
<p>
If you pass a special layer name, the visibility of those components
(silk, rats, etc) is toggled.  Note that if you have a layer named
the same as a special layer, the layer is chosen over the special layer.
