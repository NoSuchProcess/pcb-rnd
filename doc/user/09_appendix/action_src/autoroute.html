Before autorouting, it's important to set up a few things.  First,
make sure any layers you aren't using are disabled, else the
autorouter may use them.  Next, make sure the current routing
styles are set accordingly.  Last, make sure "new lines clear
polygons" is set, in case you eventually want to add a copper pour.
<p>
Autorouting takes a while.  During this time, the program may not be
responsive.
