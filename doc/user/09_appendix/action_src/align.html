	<tr><th> Lefts, Rights, Tops, Bottoms, Centers, Marks
	<td> Pick alignment point within each object

	<tr><th> First, Last, pcb_crosshair, Average
	<td> Alignment reference, First=Topmost/Leftmost, Last=Bottommost/Rightmost, Average or pcb_crosshair point

	<tr><th> Gridless 
	<td> Do not force results to align to prevailing grid.
