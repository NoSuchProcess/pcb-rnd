Import a range of glyphs from ttf outline font into the current font as
symbols, starting from a specific character position. Note: pcb-rnd
font symbols are not unicode code poitns, but consists of a single,
8 bit ASCII code page, thus values above 255 are invalid as destination
symbol code.
<p>
The <arg>srcglyph</arg> argumnet is a single <i>character description</i> or
a pair of <i>character descriptions</i> separated with two dots (".."). In the
former case the import is a single glyph, in the latter case the import
is the whole range between the two characters, inclusive (one or more glyphs).
<p>
The <arg>dstchars</arg> argumnet is always a single <i>character description</i>,
addressing within the 0..255 range of the pcb-rnd font. This argment determines
the first destination symbol that is going to be overwritten. If <arg>srcglyph</arg>
specifies multiple characters, <arg>dstchars</arg> is internally stepped
after each glyp import, up to 255, where the import stops.
<p>
A <i>character description</i> addresses a code point on the input or
a character code on the output, using one fo the following syntax variants:
<ul>
	<li> 'A' is converted to 65 (as a single charatcer using the 8 bit ASCII table)
	<li> &#10 is converted as decimal number 10
	<li> &#x10 is converted as hexadecimal number, to 16
	<li> U+10 is converted as hexadecimal number, to 16
	<li> anything else is taken as a single character and is converted as it was wrapped in ''
</ul>
<p>
The 4th argument is either polygon or line. When it is polygon, the glyph is
imported as a polygon (with or without holes). When it is line, all contours
of the glyph is imported as a series of lines. When not specified, it defaults
to polygon.
<p>
Finally, <arg>scale</arg> and <arg>offset</arg> specifies the transformation
during the import. Each argument is either a single number or a pair of numbers
separated with comma or semicolon or / or * or x, and specify the x and y
components of the transformation. When only the x component is specified, y
is assumed to be the same (this is useful for scale).
