Imports netlist (and optionally footprint references) from schematic(s) or
netlist(s). Works from one or multiple input files. This action does not
do file operations on its own, it is merely a dispatched to import plugins.
<p>
The import configuration is normally stored in the config tree of the board
file (on the <i>design</i> role of the conf system) and consists of:
<ul>
	<li> the name of the importer that will load the input files
	<li> a list of arguments to the importer (strings, most often input file names)
	<li> misc settings, e.g. verbosity of the import
</ul>
<p>
When called without argument, or with the <arg>reimport</arg> the action will
read the config and perform an import.
<p>
When called with <arg>setup</arg>, the action will store the configuration
read from the rest of the arguments:
<pre>
	<act>ImportSch</act>(setup, <arg>importer</arg>, <arg>args...</arg>)
</pre>
<p>
There can be zero or more arguments following the importer. The syntax and
meaning of those arguments are specific to the importer, but is most usually
the file name(s) to import from, e.g.
<pre>
ImportSch(setup, tEDAx, foo.tdx)
</pre>
<pre>
ImportSch(setup, gnetlist, sheet1.sch, sheet2.sch)
</pre>
<p>
When called with <arg>dialog</arg>, the action will present a non-modal
GUI dialog that allows changing the setup and performing the import.
