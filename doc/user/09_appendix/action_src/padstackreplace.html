Replacing padstacks, especially within multiple subcircuits, is a tedious
task because the prototype of the new padstack needs to be added in each
local padstack prototype library (e.g. one per subcircuit). The PadstackReplace()
action can automate this.
<p>
First argument is destination padstack, the object that is going to be changed.
It is either <i>object</i> for a single padstack under the cursor, or <i>selected</i>
for all selected padstacks. Both work on padstacks within subcircuits.
<p>
The second argument is source padstack, from which the prototype (geometry)
is copied. It can be <i>tool</i> for using the via tool's padstac prototype
(which is usually from the current style) or <i>buffer</i> which uses the
first padstack found in the current buffer.
