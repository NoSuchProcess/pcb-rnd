Arguments:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr><th> Start
	    <td> Indicates the start of an subcircuit list; call this before any
	         <arg>Need</arg> actions.

	<tr><th> Need
	    <td> Searches the board for an subcircuit with a matching refdes. <br>
	         If found, the value and footprint are updated. <br>
	         If not found, a new subcircuit is created with the given
	         footprint and value.

	<tr><th> Done
	    <td> Compares the list of subcircuits needed since the most recent
	         <arg>Start</arg> with the list of subcircuits actually on the
	         board. Any subcircuits that weren't listed are selected, so
	         that the user may delete them.
</table>
<p>
Placement of new subcircuits depends on conf node 
import/footprint_placement/method, which is a string containing
a one word instruction that is one of:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>

	<tr><th> disperse
	    <td> place all new subcircuits at randomized coordinates around
	         <i>location</i>, within a distance configured in
	         import/footprint_placement/disperse

	<tr><th> frame
	    <td> place all new subcircuits close outside of the drawing area,
	         "framing" the design

</table>

<p>
<i>Location</i> is a string instruction specified by
import/footprint_placement/location, the value is one of:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>

	<tr><th> (empty, no value)
	    <td> place around the coordinates specified in coords
	         import/footprint_placement/x and import/footprint_placement/y

	<tr><th> center
	    <td> place around the center of the drawing area

	<tr><th> mark
	    <td> place around the mark (or center of the drawing area if no mark present
	         at the moment of import)

</table>

<p>
Removal of excess subcircuits (the ones present on the board but not in
the new netlist) depends on conf node import/footprint_removalt/method,
which is a string containing a one word instruction that is one of:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>

	<tr><th> select (or empty)
	    <td> select excess subcircuits (an {s r} after the import removes them)

	<tr><th> remove
	    <td> automatically remove excess subcircuits

	<tr><th> list
	    <td> no change on excess subcircuit data on the board, but
	         open a view list dialog enumerating them

</table>

<p>
Note: subcircuits with the nonetlist flag set or empty/missing refdes
will not be taken as excess even if they are not present on the netlist.
