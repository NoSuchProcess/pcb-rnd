Arguments:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr><th> Gaps
	<td> Make gaps even rather than spreading points evenly.

	<tr><th> First, Last, pcb_crosshair
	<td> Two arguments specifying both ends of the distribution, they can't both be the same.

<p>
Defaults are Marks, First, Last
<p>
Distributed subcircuits always retain the same relative order they had
before they were distributed.
