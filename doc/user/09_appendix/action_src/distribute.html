<p>
As with <act>align</act>, plus:
<p>
Arguments:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr><th> Gaps
	<td> Make gaps even rather than spreading points evenly.

	<tr><th> First, Last, pcb_crosshair
	<td> Two arguments specifying both ends of the distribution, they can't both be the same.
</table>
<p>
Defaults are Marks, First, Last
<p>
Distributed objects always retain the same relative order they had
before they were distributed.
<p>
For non-subcircuit objects: using Marks is not recommended, using Gridless is
recommended.
