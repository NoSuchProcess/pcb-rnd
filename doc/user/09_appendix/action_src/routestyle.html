The first argument addresses the style and is one of:
<ul>
	<li> an integer greater than zero: style ID (styles are counted from 1)
	<li> @current, which will pick the style currently selected
	<li> an arbitrary style name, which will pick the first style with matching name
</ul>
<p>
The second argument is one of:
<ul>
	<li> <b>set</b>, which will modify the addressed style using the 4th argment <arg>value</arg>
	<li> <b>get</b>, where the 4th argument is omitted and the return value of the action holds the resulting value of the query
	<li> <b>del</b>, which will remove the style addressed.
