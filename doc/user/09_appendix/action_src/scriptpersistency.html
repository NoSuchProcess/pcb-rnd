When a script is unloaded, its action <act>preunload</act> is called. The
return value is saved as script persistent data. When the script is loaded
again later, it can use <act>ScriptPersistency</act>(<arg>read</arg>) to
read the data saved.
<p>
<act>ScriptPersistency</act>(<arg>remove</arg>) deletes the data from disk.
<p>
Note: the data is per script id, not per script file name.
