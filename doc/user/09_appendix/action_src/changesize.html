For lines and arcs, this changes the width.  For padstacks, this
changes the shape size (but does not touch the hole diameter). For
texts, this changes the scaling factor.
For subcircuits, this changes the width of the lines and arcs and
shape sizes of padstacks (thus mostly relative values make sense).
