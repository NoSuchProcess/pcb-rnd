Replace footprint(s) from the library or buffer, in-place (preserving
the original subcircuit's location, rotation and metadata) and append
the replacement to the back annotation changeset.
<p>
If first argument is <i>selected</i>, replace all selected subcircuits
with the new footprint; if it is <i>object</i>, replace only one
subcircuit, under the cursor.
<p>
If the second argument is a footprint name, load it from the library.
If it is <i>@buffer</i>, use the subcircuit in the current buffer (there
must be exactly 1 subcircuit in the buffer). If it is empty or not specified,
the user is asked for a footprint.
<p>
If the third argument is <i>dumb</i> the location and rotation of the
original subcircuit is not preserved (but all metadata and board side are
preserved). A dumb replacement also omits creating back annotation.
