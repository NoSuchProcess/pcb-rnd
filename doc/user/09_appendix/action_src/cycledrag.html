When multiple overlapping objects are accessible by clicking on a pixel
on the screen, drag&drop operations may become harder to do: pcb-rnd will
often "pick the wrong object" on click.
<p>
Cycledraw provides a way to get pcb-rnd to jump to selecting another object
of the avaialble ones on the original site, while the user is still in drag
mode. This obviously works only through the key binding, as selecting the
menu would require the drag operation to finish first.
