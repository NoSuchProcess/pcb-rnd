<h1> pcb-rnd actions </h1>
<h2> Action reference (details) </h2>


<h3 id="atomic">atomic</h3>
<p>
This action allows making multiple-action bindings into an atomic operation that will be undone by a single Undo command.  For example, to optimize rat lines, you'd delete the rats and re-add them.  To group these into a single undo, you'd want the deletions and the additions to have the same undo serial number.  So, you 
<i>Save</i>
, delete the rats, 
<i>Restore</i>
, add the rats - using the same serial number as the deletes, then 
<i>Block</i>
, which checks to see if the deletions or additions actually did anything.  If not, the serial number is set to the saved number, as there's nothing to undo.  If something did happen, the serial number is incremented so that these actions are counted as a single undo step. 

<h3 id="changejoin">changejoin</h3>
<p>
The join flag determines whether a line or arc, drawn to intersect a polygon, electrically connects to the polygon or not.  When joined, the line/arc is simply drawn over the polygon, making an electrical connection.  When not joined, a gap is drawn between the line and the polygon, insulating them from each other. 

<h3 id="chklayer">chklayer</h3>
<p>
Returns 1 if the specified layer is the active layer. 

<h3 id="chkrst">chkrst</h3>
<p>
Return 1 if route_style_id matches pen. 

<h3 id="chkview">chkview</h3>
<p>
Return 1 if layerid is visible. Intended for menu item 'checked' fields. 

<h3 id="getxy">getxy</h3>
<p>
Prompts the user for a coordinate, if one is not already selected. 

<h3 id="netlist">netlist</h3>
<p>
Each of these actions apply to a specified set of nets. 
<i>net</i>
 and 
<i>pin</i>
 are patterns which match one or more nets or pins; these patterns may be full names or regular expressions.  If an exact match is found, it is the only match; if no exact match is found, 
<b>
then
</b>
 the pattern is tried as a regular expression. 
<p>
 If neither 
<i>net</i>
 nor 
<i>pin</i>
 are specified, all nets apply. If 
<i>net</i>
 is specified but not 
<i>pin</i>
, all nets matching 
<i>net</i>
 apply.  If both are specified, nets which match 
<i>net</i>
 and contain a pin matching 
<i>pin</i>
 apply. 
<p>
 
<i>freeze</i>
, 
<i>thaw</i>
 and 
<i>forcethaw</i>
 temporarily prevents changes to the netlist from being reflected in the GUI. For example, if you need to make multiple changes, you 
<i>freeze</i>
 the netlist, make the changes, then 
<i>thaw</i>
 it. Note that freeze/thaw requests may nest, with the netlist being fully thawed only when all pending freezes are thawed.  You can bypass the nesting by using 
<i>forcethaw</i>
, which resets the freeze count and immediately updates the GUI. 

<h3 id="printcalibrate">printcalibrate</h3>
<p>
This will print a calibration page, which you would measure and type the measurements in, so that future printouts will be more precise. 

<h3 id="promptfor">promptfor</h3>
<p>
This is mostly for testing the lesstif HID interface. The parameters are passed to the 
<i>
prompt_for()
</i>
 HID function, causing the user to be prompted for a response. The respose is simply printed to the user's stdout.   

<h3 id="redo">redo</h3>
<p>
The 
<a href="#redo">redo</a>
 action allows you to recover from the last undo command. You might want to do this if you thought that undo was going to revert something other than what it actually did (in case you are confused about which operations are un-doable), or if you have been backing up through a long undo list and over-shoot your stopping point.  Any change that is made since the undo in question will trim the redo list.  For example if you add ten lines, then undo three of them you could use redo to put them back, but if you move a line on the board before performing the redo, you will lose the ability to "redo" the three "undone" lines. 

<h3 id="toggleview">toggleview</h3>
<p>
If you pass an integer, that layer is specified by index (the first layer is 
<i>
1
</i>
, etc).  If you pass a layer name, that layer is specified by name.  When a layer is specified, the visibility of the layer group containing that layer is toggled. 
<p>
 If you pass a special layer name, the visibility of those components (silk, rats, etc) is toggled.  Note that if you have a layer named the same as a special layer, the layer is chosen over the special layer. 

<h3 id="undo">undo</h3>
<p>
The unlimited undo feature of pcb-rnd allows you to recover from most operations that materially affect you work.  Calling 
<a href="#pcb_undo">pcb_undo</a>
 without any parameter recovers from the last (non-undo) operation. 
<i>ClearList</i>
 is used to release the allocated memory. 
<i>ClearList</i>
 is called whenever a new layout is started or loaded. See also 
<a href="#redo">redo</a>
. 
<p>
 Note that undo groups operations by serial number; changes with the same serial number will be undone (or redone) as a group.  See 
<a href="#atomic">atomic</a>
.
