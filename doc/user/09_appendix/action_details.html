<h3 id="applyvendor">applyvendor</h3>
<p>
This will modify all of your drill holes to match the list of allowed sizes for your vendor. 

<h3 id="atomic">atomic</h3>
<p>
This action allows making multiple-action bindings into an atomic operation that will be undone by a single Undo command.  For example, to optimize rat lines, you'd delete the rats and re-add them.  To group these into a single undo, you'd want the deletions and the additions to have the same undo serial number.  So, you 
<i>Save</i>
, delete the rats, 
<i>Restore</i>
, add the rats - using the same serial number as the deletes, then 
<i>Block</i>
, which checks to see if the deletions or additions actually did anything.  If not, the serial number is set to the saved number, as there's nothing to undo.  If something did happen, the serial number is incremented so that these actions are counted as a single undo step. 
<p>
 Arguments: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
  
<tr>

<th>
 Save  
<td>
 Saves the undo serial number.   
<tr>

<th>
 Restore  
<td>
 Returns it to the last saved number.   
<tr>

<th>
 Close  
<td>
 Sets it to 1 greater than the last save.   
<tr>

<th>
 Block  
<td>
 Does a Restore if there was nothing to undo, else does a Close. 
</table>
 

<h3 id="attributes">attributes</h3>
<p>
Pops up a dialog letting the user edit the attributes of the pcb, a subcircuit, or a layer.  

<h3 id="autoplaceselected">autoplaceselected</h3>
<p>
Attempts to re-arrange the selected components such that the nets connecting them are minimized.  Note that you cannot undo this. 

<h3 id="autoroute">autoroute</h3>
<p>
Before autorouting, it's important to set up a few things.  First, make sure any layers you aren't using are disabled, else the autorouter may use them.  Next, make sure the current routing styles are set accordingly.  Last, make sure "new lines clear polygons" is set, in case you eventually want to add a copper pour. 
<p>
 Autorouting takes a while.  During this time, the program may not be responsive. 
<p>
 Arguments: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
  
<tr>

<th>
 AllRats  
<td>
 Attempt to autoroute all rats.   
<tr>

<th>
 SelectedRats  
<td>
 Attempt to autoroute the selected rats. 
</table>
 

<h3 id="benchmark">benchmark</h3>
<p>
This action is used to speed-test the GUI rendering.  It redraws the current screen as many times as possible in ten seconds. It reports the amount of time needed to draw the screen once, in average. 

<h3 id="boardflip">boardflip</h3>
<p>
All objects on the board are up-down flipped (mirrored over the x axis). 
<p>
 Command line board flipping: 
<pre>
 echo " BoardFlip() SaveTo(LayoutAs,$OUTFILE) Quit() " | pcb $INFILE 
</pre>
 
<p>
 To flip the board physically, use BoardFlip(sides) 

<h3 id="center">center</h3>
<p>
Move the pointer to the center of the window, but only if it's currently within the window already. 

<h3 id="changeclearsize">changeclearsize</h3>
<p>
If the solder mask is currently showing, this action changes the solder mask cutout size. If the mask is not showing, this action changes the polygon clearance. 

<h3 id="changeflag">changeflag</h3>
<p>
Toggles the given flag on the indicated object(s).  The flag may be one of the flags listed above (thermal, join).  The value may be the number 0 or 1.  If the value is 0, the flag is cleared.  If the value is 1, the flag is set. 

<h3 id="changejoin">changejoin</h3>
<p>
The join flag determines whether a line or arc, drawn to intersect a polygon, electrically connects to the polygon or not.  When joined, the line/arc is simply drawn over the polygon, making an electrical connection.  When not joined, a gap is drawn between the line and the polygon, insulating them from each other. 

<h3 id="changename">changename</h3>
<p>
Arguments: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
   
<tr>

<th>
 Object  
<td>
 Changes the name of the element under the cursor.   
<tr>

<th>
 Layout  
<td>
 Changes the name of the layout. This is printed on the fab drawings.   
<tr>

<th>
 Layer  
<td>
 Changes the name of the currently active layer.  
</table>
  

<h3 id="changepinname">changepinname</h3>
<p>
This can be especially useful for annotating pin names from a schematic to the layout without requiring knowledge of the pcb file format. 
<p>
 
Example: ChangePinName(U3, 7, VCC) <br>
 

<h3 id="changesize">changesize</h3>
<p>
For lines and arcs, this changes the width.  For padstacks, this changes the shape size (but does not touch the hole diameter). For texts, this changes the scaling factor.  For subcircuits, this changes the width of the silk layer lines and arcs for this subcircuit (TODO: is this still true?).  

<h3 id="changesizes">changesizes</h3>
<p>
Call ChangeSize, ChangeDrillSize and ChangeClearSize with the same arguments. If any of them did not fail, return success. 

<h3 id="chklayer">chklayer</h3>
<p>
Returns 1 if the specified layer is the active layer. 

<h3 id="chkrst">chkrst</h3>
<p>
Return 1 if route_style_id matches pen. 

<h3 id="chkview">chkview</h3>
<p>
Return 1 if layerid is visible. Intended for menu item 'checked' fields. 

<h3 id="clrflag">clrflag</h3>
<p>
Turns the given flag off, regardless of its previous setting.  See 
<a href="#changeflag">changeflag</a>
. 
<p>
 
Example: ClrFlag(SelectedLines,join) <br>
 

<h3 id="command">command</h3>
<p>
The command window allows the user to manually enter actions to be executed. 
<p>
 There are two ways to finish with the command window.  If you press the 
<i>
Enter
</i>
 key, the command is invoked, the entry normally goes away, and the next time you bring up the command window it's empty.  If you press the 
<i>
Esc
</i>
 key, the window goes away without invoking anything, and the next time you bring up the command window it's empty. 
<p>
 Use the 
<i>
up
</i>
 and 
<i>
down
</i>
 arrow keys to access command history.  

<h3 id="connection">connection</h3>
<p>
Connections found with this action will be highlighted in the "connected-color" color and will have the "found" flag set. 
<p>
 Arguments: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
  
<tr>

<th>
 Find  
<td>
 The net under the cursor is "found".   
<tr>

<th>
 ResetLinesAndPolygons  
<td>
 Any "found" lines and polygons are marked "not found".   
<tr>

<th>
 ResetPinsAndVias  
<td>
 Any "found" pins and vias are marked "not found".   
<tr>

<th>
 Reset  
<td>
 All "found" objects are marked "not found".  
</table>
  

<h3 id="cursor">cursor</h3>
<p>
This action moves the mouse cursor.  Unlike other actions which take coordinates, this action's coordinates are always relative to the user's view of the board.  Thus, a positive 
<i>DeltaUp</i>
 may move the cursor away from the board origin if the board is inverted (flipped, looked from the bottom). 
<p>
 
<i>Type</i>
 is one of 
<i>
Pan
</i>
 or 
<i>
Warp
</i>
. 
<i>
Pan
</i>
 causes the viewport to move such that the crosshair is under the mouse cursor. 
<i>
Warp
</i>
 causes the mouse cursor to move to be above the crosshair. 
<p>
 
<i>Units</i>
 can be one of the following: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
  
<tr>

<td>
mil
<br>
mm  
<td>
The cursor is moved by that amount, in board units.   
<tr>

<td>
grid  
<td>
The cursor is moved by that many grid points.   
<tr>

<td>
view  
<td>
The values are percentages of the viewport's view. Thus, a pan of      
<i>
100
</i>
 would scroll the viewport by exactly the width of the current view.    
<tr>

<td>
board  
<td>
 The values are percentages of the board size. Thus, a move of       
<i>
50,50
</i>
 moves you halfway across the board.  
</table>
 

<h3 id="disperseelements">disperseelements</h3>
<p>
Normally this is used when starting a board, by selecting all subcircuits and then dispersing them.  This scatters the subcircuits around the board so that you can pick individual ones, rather than have all the subcircuits at the same 0,0 coordinate and thus impossible to choose from. 

<h3 id="display">display</h3>
<p>
Changes random display related global states. 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
  
<tr>

<th>
 SubcID 
<br>
 Description 
<br>
 Value  
<td>
Specify the subcircuit ID template to be printed on the subcircuit layer   
<tr>

<th>
 Redraw  
<td>
Redraw the whole board.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleAllDirections  
<td>
When clear, lines can be drawn at any angle.  When set, lines are      restricted to multiples of 45 degrees and requested lines may be      broken up according to the clip setting.   
<tr>

<th>
 CycleClip  
<td>
Changes the way lines are restricted to 45 degree increments. The      various settings are: straight only, orthogonal then angled, and angled      then orthogonal. If AllDirections is set, this action disables it.   
<tr>

<th>
 CycleCrosshair  
<td>
Changes crosshair drawing. Crosshair may accept form of 4-ray,      8-ray and 12-ray cross.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleRubberBandMode  
<td>
If set, moving an object moves all the lines attached to it too.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleStartDirection  
<td>
If set, each time you set a point in a line, the Clip toggles between      orth-angle and angle-ortho.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleUniqueNames  
<td>
If set, you will not be permitted to change the name of an element to      match that of another element.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleSnapPin  
<td>
If set, pin centers and pad end points are treated as additional grid      points that the cursor can snap to.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleSnapOffGridLine  
<td>
If set, snap at some sensible point along a line.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleHighlightOnPoint  
<td>
If set, highlights lines and arcs when the crosshair is on one of their      two (end) points.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleLocalRef  
<td>
If set, the mark is automatically set to the beginning of any move, so      you can see the relative distance you've moved.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleThindraw  
<td>
If set, objects on the screen are drawn as outlines (lines are drawn      as center-lines). This lets you see line endpoints hidden under pins,      for example.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleThindrawPoly  
<td>
If set, polygons on the screen are drawn as outlines.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleShowDRC  
<td>
If set, pending objects (i.e. lines you're in the process of drawing)      will be drawn with an outline showing how far away from other copper      you need to be.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleLiveRoute  
<td>
If set, the progress of the autorouter will be visible on the screen.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleAutoDRC  
<td>
If set, you will not be permitted to make connections which violate      the current DRC and netlist settings.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleCheckPlanes  
<td>
If set, lines and arcs aren't drawn, which usually leaves just the      polygons.  If you also disable all but the layer you're interested in,      this allows you to check for isolated regions.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleOrthoMove  
<td>
If set, the crosshair is only allowed to move orthogonally from its      previous position.  I.e. you can move a subcircuit or line up, down,      left, or right, but not up+left or down+right.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleName  
<td>
Selects whether the pinouts show the pin names or the pin numbers.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleLockNames  
<td>
If set, text will ignore left mouse clicks and actions that work on      objects under the mouse. You can still select text with a lasso (left      mouse drag) and perform actions on the selection.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleOnlyNames  
<td>
If set, only text will be sensitive for mouse clicks and actions that      work on objects under the mouse. You can still select other objects      with a lasso (left mouse drag) and perform actions on the selection.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleClearLine  
<td>
When set, the clear-line flag causes new lines and arcs to have their      "clear polygons" flag set, so they won't be electrically connected      to any polygons they overlap.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleFullPoly  
<td>
When set, the full-poly flag causes new polygons to have their      "full polygon" flag set, so all parts of them will be displayed      instead of only the biggest one.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToggleGrid  
<td>
Resets the origin of the current grid to be wherever the crosshair is.      If you provide two numbers after this, the origin is set to that      coordinate.   
<tr>

<th>
 Grid  
<td>
Toggles whether the grid is displayed or not.   
<tr>

<th>
 Pinout  
<td>
Causes the pinout of the subcircuit indicated by the cursor to be      displayed, usually in a separate window.   
<tr>

<th>
 PinOrPadName  
<td>
Toggles whether the names of terminals will be      displayed. If the cursor is over an subcircuit, all of its terminals      are affected.  
</table>

The different types of optimizations change your board in order to reduce the total trace length and via count. 
<p>
 Arguments: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
   
<tr>

<th>
 debumpify  
<td>
 Looks for U-shaped traces that can be shortened or eliminated.   
<tr>

<th>
 unjaggy  
<td>
 Looks for corners which could be flipped to eliminate one or more       corners (i.e. jaggy lines become simpler).   
<tr>

<th>
 simple  
<td>
 Removing uneeded vias, replacing two or more trace segments in a row       with a single segment.  This is usually performed automatically after       other optimizations.   
<tr>

<th>
 vianudge  
<td>
 Looks for vias where all traces leave in the same direction.  Tries to       move via in that direction to eliminate one of the traces (and thus a       corner).   
<tr>

<th>
 viatrim  
<td>
 Looks for traces that go from via to via, where moving that trace to a       different layer eliminates one or both vias.   
<tr>

<th>
 orthopull  
<td>
 Looks for chains of traces all going in one direction, with more       traces orthogonal on one side than on the other.  Moves the chain in       that direction, causing a net reduction in trace length, possibly       eliminating traces and/or corners.   
<tr>

<th>
 splitlines  
<td>
 Looks for lines that pass through vias, pins, or pads, and splits them       into separate lines so they can be managed separately.   
<tr>

<th>
 auto  
<td>
 Performs the above options, repeating until no further optimizations       can be made.   
<tr>

<th>
 miter  
<td>
 Replaces 90 degree corners with a pair of 45 degree corners, to reduce       RF losses and trace length.

<h3 id="flip">flip</h3>
<p>
Note that the location of the subcircuit will be symmetric about the cursor location; i.e. if the part you are pointing at will still be at the same spot once the subcircuit is on the other side.  When flipping multiple subcircuits, this retains their positions relative to each other, not their absolute positions on the board.

<h3 id="import">import</h3>
<p>
Imports subcircuits and netlist data from the schematics (or some other source).  The first parameter, which is optional, is the mode.  If not specified, the 
<i>
import::mode
</i>
 attribute in the board is used. Possible values: 
<i>
gnetlist
</i>
 means gnetlist is used to obtain the information from the schematics;  
<i>
make
</i>
 invokes make, assuming the user has a Makefile in the current directory.  The Makefile will be invoked with the following variables set: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
         
<tr>

<th>
PCB  
<td>
 The name of the .pcb file   
<tr>

<th>
 SRCLIST  
<td>
 A space-separated list of source files   
<tr>

<th>
 OUT  
<td>
 The name of the file in which to put the command script, which may       contain any @pcb{} actions.  By default, this is a temporary file       selected by @pcb{}, but if you specify an 
<i>
import::outfile
</i>
       attribute, that file name is used instead (and not automatically       deleted afterwards). 
</table>
 
<p>
 The target specified to be built is the first of these that apply:  
<ul>
  
<li>
The target specified by an 
<i>
import::target
</i>
 attribute.  
<li>
The output file specified by an 
<i>
import::outfile
</i>
 attribute.  
<li>
If nothing else is specified, the target is 
<i>
pcb_import
</i>
. 
</ul>
  
<p>
 If you specify an 
<i>
import::makefile
</i>
 attribute, then "-f 
<i>
that file
</i>
" will be added to the command line. 
<p>
 If you specify the mode, you may also specify the source files (schematics).  If you do not specify any, the list of schematics is obtained by reading the 
<i>
import::srcN
</i>
 attributes (like 
<i>
import::src0
</i>
, 
<i>
import::src1
</i>
, etc). 
<p>
 For compatibility with future extensions to the import file format, the generated file 
<b>
must not
</b>
 start with the two characters #%. 
<p>
 If a temporary file is needed the 
<i>
TMPDIR
</i>
 environment variable is used to select its location. 
<p>
 Note that the programs 
<i>
gnetlist
</i>
 and 
<i>
make
</i>
 must be configured. 
<p>
 If pcb-rnd cannot determine which schematic(s) to import from, the GUI is called to let user choose (see 
<a href="#importgui()">importgui()</a>
). 
<p>
 Note that 
<a href="#import()">import()</a>
 doesn't delete anything - after an Import, subcircuits which shouldn't be on the board are selected and may be removed once it's determined that the deletion is appropriate. TODO: is this still true? 
<p>
 If 
<a href="#import()">import()</a>
 is called with 
<i>setnewpoint</i>
, then the location of new components can be specified.  This is where parts show up when they're added to the board.  The default is the center of the board.  Argument combinations: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
  
<tr>

<th>
 Import(setnewpoint)  
<td>
 Prompts the user to click on the board somewhere, uses that point.  If       called by a hotkey, uses the current location of the crosshair.   
<tr>

<th>
 Import(setnewpoint,mark)  
<td>
 Uses the location of the mark.  If no mark is present, the point is       not changed.   
<tr>

<th>
 Import(setnewpoint,center)  
<td>
 Resets the point to the center of the board.   
<tr>

<th>
 Import(setnewpoint,X,Y,units)  
<td>
 Sets the point to the specific coordinates given.
<br>
       
<exampl>
Import(setnewpoint,50,25,mm)
</example>
  
</table>
  
<p>
 Note that the 
<i>X</i>
 and 
<i>Y</i>
 locations are stored in attributes named 
<i>
import::newX
</i>
 and 
<i>
import::newY}
</i>
 so you could change them manually if you wished. 
<p>
 Calling 
<i>
Import(setdisperse,D,units)
</i>
 sets how much the newly placed subcircuits are dispersed relative to the set point.  For example, 
<i>
Import(setdisperse,10,mm)
</i>
 will offset each part randomly up to 10mm away from the point.  The default dispersion is 1/10th of the smallest board dimension.  Dispersion is saved in the 
<i>
import::disperse
</i>
 attribute. 

<h3 id="importgui">importgui</h3>
<p>
Displays a dialog that lets the user select the schematic(s) to import from, then saves that information in the layout's attributes for future imports. 

<h3 id="l">l</h3>
<p>
Loads a new datafile (layout) and, if confirmed, overwrites any existing unsaved data. If no filename is specified a file select box will popup.  

<h3 id="le">le</h3>
<p>
The 
<i>filename</i>
 is passed to the footprint loader.  If no filename is specified a file select box will popup. 

<h3 id="load">load</h3>
<p>
This action is a GUI front-end to the core's 
<a href="#loadfrom">loadfrom</a>
 action. If you happen to pass a filename, 
<a href="#loadfrom">loadfrom</a>
 is called directly. Else, the user is prompted for a filename to load, and then 
<a href="#loadfrom">loadfrom</a>
 is called with that filename.  

<h3 id="loadfootprint">loadfootprint</h3>
<p>
Loads a single footprint by name, rather than by reference or through the library.  If a refdes and value are specified, those are inserted into the footprint as well.  The footprint remains in the paste buffer.  

<h3 id="loadfrom">loadfrom</h3>
<p>
This action assumes you know what the filename is.  The various GUIs should have a similar 
<a href="#load">load</a>
 action where the filename is optional, and will provide their own file selection mechanism to let you choose the file name. 
<p>
 Arguments: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>

<h3 id="m">m</h3>
<p>
If no filename is specified a file select box will popup. 

<h3 id="markcrosshair">markcrosshair</h3>
<p>
The "mark" is a small X-shaped target on the display which is treated like a second origin (the normal origin is the upper let corner of the board).  The GUI will display a second set of coordinates for this mark, which tells you how far you are from it. 
<p>
 If no argument is given, the mark is toggled - disabled if it was enabled, or enabled at the current cursor position of disabled.  If the 
<i>Center</i>
 argument is given, the mark is moved to the current cursor location. 

<h3 id="message">message</h3>
<p>
This action displays a message to the log window.  This action is primarily provided for use by scripts and external programs which may interface with pcb-rnd. If multiple arguments are given, each one is sent to the log window followed by a newline. 

<h3 id="mincleargap">mincleargap</h3>
<p>
Checks all specified objects, and increases the polygon clearance if needed to ensure a minimum distance between their edges and the polygon edges.

 if they are prefixed by + or -, otherwise, they are absolute.  Units can be 
<i>
mil
</i>
 or 
<i>

</i>
 and is used when 
<i>X</i>
 and 
<i>Y</i>
 have no unit specified. If no unit unspecified in coords or units, nanometer is assumed. 

<h3 id="movetocurrentlayer">movetocurrentlayer</h3>
<p>
Note that moving an subcircuit from a component layer to a solder layer, or from solder to component, won't automatically flip it.  Use the 
<a href="#flip">flip</a>
 action to do that.  

<h3 id="netlist">netlist</h3>
<p>
Each of these actions apply to a specified set of nets. 
<i>net</i>
 and 
<i>pin</i>
 are patterns which match one or more nets or pins; these patterns may be full names or regular expressions.  If an exact match is found, it is the only match; if no exact match is found, 
<b>
then
</b>
 the pattern is tried as a regular expression. 
<p>
 If neither 
<i>net</i>
 nor 
<i>pin</i>
 are specified, all nets apply. If 
<i>net</i>
 is specified but not 
<i>pin</i>
, all nets matching 
<i>net</i>
 apply.  If both are specified, nets which match 
<i>net</i>
 and contain a pin matching 
<i>pin</i>
 apply. 
<p>
 
<i>freeze</i>
, 
<i>thaw</i>
 and 
<i>forcethaw</i>
 temporarily prevents changes to the netlist from being reflected in the GUI. For example, if you need to make multiple changes, you 
<i>freeze</i>
 the netlist, make the changes, then 
<i>thaw</i>
 it. Note that freeze/thaw requests may nest, with the netlist being fully thawed only when all pending freezes are thawed.  You can bypass the nesting by using 
<i>forcethaw</i>
, which resets the freeze count and immediately updates the GUI.

<h3 id="pastebuffer">pastebuffer</h3>
<p>
There are a number of paste buffers; the actual limit is a compile-time constant 
<i>
PCB_MAX_BUFFER
</i>
.  It is normally 
<i>
5

.  One of these is the "current" paste buffer, often referred to as "the" paste buffer.  Arguments: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
   
<tr>

<th>
 AddSelected  
<td>
 Copies the selected objects to the current paste buffer.   
<tr>

<th>
 Clear

<td>
 Convert the current paste buffer to an subcircuit.   
<tr>

<th>
 Restore  
<td>
 Convert any subcircuit in the paste buffer back to plain objects.   
<tr>

<th>
 Mirror  
<td>
 Flip all objects in the paste buffer vertically (up/down flip).  To mirror       horizontally, combine this with rotations.   
<tr>

<th>
 Rotate  
<td>
 Rotates the current buffer.  The number to pass is 1..3, where 1 means       90 degrees counter clockwise, 2 means 180 degrees, and 3 means 90       degrees clockwise (270 CCW).   
<tr>

<th>
 Normalize  
<td>
 Set the buffer origin to the center of the paste buffer bounding box.       This is useful especially if an import plugin loaded objects in the buffer       with a large offset.   
<tr>

<th>
 Save  
<td>
 Saves any elements in the current buffer to the indicated file. If       format is specified, try to use that file format, else use the default.       If force is specified, overwrite target, don't ask.   
<tr>

<th>
 ToLayout  
<td>
 Pastes objects in the current buffer to the indicated X, Y       coordinates in the layout.  The 
<i>X</i>
 and 
<i>Y</i>
 are treated like       
<i>delta</i>
 is for many other objects.  For each, if it's prefixed by       + or -, then that amount is relative to the last       location.  Otherwise, it's absolute. If units is unspecified, units are PCB's internal       units, currently nanometer. If "crosshair" is used instead of coordinates,       the paste happens at the current crosshair coords.

<h3 id="polygon">polygon</h3>
<p>
Argument: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
  
<tr>

<th>
 Close  
<td>
 Creates the final segment of the polygon.  This may fail if clipping       to 45 degree lines is switched on, in which case a warning is issued.   
<tr>

<th>

<h3 id="polystitch">polystitch</h3>
<p>
The polygon under the cursor (based on closest-corner) is stitched together with the polygon surrounding it on the same layer. 
<p>
 Use with pstoedit conversions where there's a "hole" in the shape - select the hole. 

<h3 id="print">print</h3>
<p>
This will find the default printing HID, prompt the user for its options, and print the layout.  

<h3 id="printcalibrate">printcalibrate</h3>
<p>
This will print a calibration page, which you would measure and type the measurements in, so that future printouts will be more precise. 

<h3 id="promptfor">promptfor</h3>
<p>
This is mostly for testing the lesstif HID interface. The parameters are passed to the 
<i>
prompt_for()
</i>
 HID function, causing the user to be prompted for a response. The respose is simply printed to the user's stdout.   

<h3 id="puller">puller</h3>
<p>
The 
<a href="#puller">puller</a>
 action is a special-purpose optimization.  When invoked while the crosshair is over the junction of an arc and a line, it will adjust the arc's angle and the connecting line's endpoint such that the line intersects the arc at a tangent. 

<h3 id="q">q</h3>
<p>
If you have unsaved changes, you will be prompted to confirm (or save) before quitting, unless the action name included a !. 

<h3 id="quit">quit</h3>
<p>
If you have unsaved changes, you will be prompted to confirm (or save) before quitting. 

<h3 id="redo">redo</h3>
<p>
The 
<a href="#redo">redo</a>
 action allows you to recover from the last undo command. You might want to do this if you thought that undo was going to revert something other than what it actually did (in case you are confused about which operations are un-doable), or if you have been backing up through a long undo list and over-shoot your stopping point.  Any change that is made since the undo in question will trim the redo list.  For example if you add ten lines, then undo three of them you could use redo to put them back, but if you move a line on the board before performing the redo, you will lose the ability to "redo" the three "undone" lines. 

<h3 id="renumberblock">renumberblock</h3>
<p>

Example: RenumberBlock(oldnum,newnum) <br>
 
<p>
 All selected elements are renumbered by adding (newnum-oldnum) to the existing number. 
<p>
 
Example: RenumberBlock(100,200) <br>
 will change R213 to R313. 

<h3 id="renumberbuffer">renumberbuffer</h3>

This action changes the way you view the board (flipping the board). 
<p>
 Arguments: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
   
<tr>

<th>
 v  
<td>
 Flips the board over vertically (up/down).   
<tr>

<th>
 h

<p>
 If no argument is given, the board isn't moved but the opposite side is shown. 
<p>
 Normally, this action changes which pads and silk layer are drawn as pcb_true silk, and which are drawn as the "invisible" layer.  It also determines which solder mask you see. 
<p>
 If 
<i>S</i>
 is specified as a second argument, if the layer group for the side you're looking at is visible and currently active, and the layer group for the opposite is not visible (i.e. disabled), then this action will also swap which layer group is visible and active, effectively swapping the "working side" of the board. 

<h3 id="toggleview">toggleview</h3>
<p>
If you pass an integer, that layer is specified by index (the first layer is 
<i>
1
</i>
, etc).  If you pass a layer name, that layer is specified by name.  When a layer is specified, the visibility of the layer group containing that layer is toggled. 
<p>
 If you pass a special layer name, the visibility of those components (silk, rats, etc) is toggled.  Note that if you have a layer named the same as a special layer, the layer is chosen over the special layer. 

<h3 id="undo">undo</h3>
<p>
The unlimited undo feature of pcb-rnd allows you to recover from most operations that materially affect you work.  Calling 
<a href="#pcb_undo">pcb_undo</a>

<th>
 All  
<td>
 Unselect all objects.   
<tr>

<th>
 Block  
<td>
 Unselect all objects in a rectangle given by the cursor.   
<tr>

<th>
 Connection  
<td>
 Unselect all connections with the "found" flag set.

<a href="#s">s</a>
 combined with 
<a href="#q">q</a>
. 

<h3 id="zoom">zoom</h3>
<p>
Changes the zoom (magnification) of the view of the board.  If no arguments are passed, the view is scaled such that the board just fits inside the visible window (i.e. "view all").  Otherwise, 
<i>factor</i>
 specifies a change in zoom factor. It may be prefixed by 
<i>
+
</i>
, 
<i>
-
</i>
, 
<i>
=
</i>
 to change how the zoom factor is modified (relative or absolute).  The 
<i>factor</i>
 is a floating point number, such as 
<i>
1.5
</i>
 or 
<i>
0.75
</i>
. 
<p>
 Alternatively a box can be specified with 4 coordinates and 
<a href="#zoom">zoom</a>
 will set the zoom level (and modifies pan) so that the given box of the design is visible and as large as possible in the current window. 
<p>
 Arguments: 
<p>
 
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
   
<tr>

<th>
 +factor  
<td>
 Values greater than 1.0 cause the board to be drawn smaller; more of       the board will be visible.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 cause the board       to be drawn bigger; less of the board will be visible.   
<tr>

<th>
 -factor  
<td>
 Values greater than 1.0 cause the board to be drawn bigger; less of       the board will be visible.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 cause the board       to be drawn smaller; more of the board will be visible.   
<tr>

<th>
 =factor  
<td>
 The @var{factor} is an absolute zoom factor; the unit for this value       is "PCB units per screen pixel".  Since PCB units are nanometer, a       
<i>factor</i>
 of 1000 means 1 micrometer per pixel (TODO: test this).   
<tr>

<th>
 x1, y1, x2, y2  
<td>
 Zoom to the specified portion of the design, described as a rectangle       (using board space coordinates)   
<tr>

<th>
 selected  
<td>
 Zoom and pan so that all 
<i>
selected
</i>
 objects are on the screen.   
<tr>

<th>
 found  
<td>
 Zoom and pan so that all 
<i>
found
</i>
 objects are on the screen.   
<tr>

<th>
 ?  
<td>
 Print the current zoom level in the message log (as an info line).   
<tr>

<th>
 get  
<td>
 Return the zoom level in the message log (as an info line).  
</table>
 
<p>
 Note that zoom factors of zero are silently ignored.
