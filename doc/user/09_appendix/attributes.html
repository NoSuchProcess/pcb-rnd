<h1> attributes recognized </h1>
<p>
Attributes are key-value pairs attached to objects. The format and content
of both keys and values are free form. Most of the time the meaning of
an attribute is defined by the user and the only code that process
the attribute are user scripts.
<p>
However, there are a few attributes recognized and parsed by pcb-rnd. This
document lists those attributes.

<h2> Object attribute details </h2>

<h3 id="term">term</h3>
<p>
Terminal ID is the unique identifier of a terminal (pin, pad, lead of a part).
Together with the subcircuit's refdes, the terminal ID is used to identify the
terminal on the netlist. Very often matches the datasheet's pin number.

<h3 id="intconn">intconn</h3>
<p>
Value is a small positive integer. Terminals within the same subc sharing the
same intconn value are connected within the package, even if terminal IDs differ.
The connection is invisible/implied. Used to indicate in-package connections
(e.g. zero ohm resistor used for an extra layer).


<h3 id="intnoconn">intnoconn</h3>
<p>
Value is a small positive integer. Copper objects within the same subc sharing the
same intnoconn value are assumed to have no connection with each other even if
they overlap by geometry. Used to break unwanted connection in a subcircuit,
e.g. to avoid shorts in a 2 terminal antenna or coil footprint.

<h3 id="noexport">noexport</h3>
<p>
A drawing primitive that has the noexport attribute (with any value) is marked
on the screen with an overlay X mark and is not exported to any of the
graphical exports. A noexport:<i>exportername</i> attribute will inhibit
the object only from the named exporter (e.g. noexport:png will make
the object disappear from the png export but not from any other exports).
Multiple noexport:<i>exportername</i> can be used.
<p>
Some side effects of the object will not disappear:
<ul>
	<li> clearance in nearby polygons are preserved
	<li> the object contributes in bounding box calculation
</ul>
<p>
The noexport attribute on padstacks will inhibit all shapes (including the slot)
and the hole too.
<p>
Graphical exports are those that use the central draw mechanism for getting
the drawing primitives generated. Some exporters, typically the ones that
export data (and not drawing) will not call the draw API and thus will ignore
the noexport attribute.
