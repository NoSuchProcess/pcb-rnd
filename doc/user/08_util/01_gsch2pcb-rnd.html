<h2> 8.1. gsch2pcb-rnd </h2>
<p>
Gsch2pcb-rnd is a standalone utility that can extract netlists and
element data from a schematics produced by gschem. Thus it is a glue
between gschem and pcb-rnd, doing <i>forward annotation</i>. It is ideal
for automating the design process as it can be easily called from
Makefiles, shell scripts or other programs/scripts, whereas the
"import schematics" feautre (import_sch plugin) is more geared for the
GUI user.
<p>
Multiple <i>methods</i> of operation are offered - the user can select
one of these by name, using the -m command line argument (e.g.
<i>gsch2pcb-rnd -m importsep foo.sch</i>):
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td> method name
		<td> description
	<tr>
		<td> import
		<td> Runs the same gnetlist backend as the import_sch plugin. A single
		     action command file generated with .cmd suffix. When executed
		     (using action <i>ExcuteFile(foo.cmd)</i>), it syncs (replaces/creates)
		     every element and sets up all nets. Pro: single-command import.
		     Con: can't load netlist only or elements only.
	<tr>
		<td> importsep
		<td> Similar to import, but produces two files: a .cmd file with element
		     updates only (can be appled the same way as import's) and a
		     separate .net netlist file that can be imported the same way as the
		     .net of the pcb method. Pro: the user can update elements-only or
		     nets-only. Con: requires two user actions to get a full impoty.
	<tr>
		<td> <strike>pcb</strike>
		<td> The classic approach that tried to edit the .pcb file.
		     <b>No longer supported</b>.
