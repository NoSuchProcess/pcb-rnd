<h3> 7.3.3 export_bom </h3>
<p>
Export_bom is a configurable template based export plugin that prints
the BoM (Bill of Materials) list in a text file. The plugin classifies
subcircuits by a templatable ID and count how many instances of each ID
has on the board. The output contains an optional file header, then an optional
block (typically a single line) for each unique ID and an optional file
footer.
<p>
In pseudo-code:
<pre>
print header_template
foreach <i>subc</i> in subcircuits {
	id = template_render(subc, sort_id_template)
	items[id]++
}
sort(items[] by id)
foreach i in items[] {
	print item_template_for_i
}
print footer_template
</pre>
<p>

<h4> 7.3.3.1 Template configuration </h4>
<p>
Each bom export format has an user assigned <i>NAME</i> (which is the short name of the format).
There is a list of strings in the config tree under plugins/export_xy/templates;
each item is named as <i>NAME</i>.<i>something</i> where <i>something</i> is:
<ul>
	<lI> <i>NAME</i>.name: the long name of the format (as shown on the UI); mandatory
	<li> <i>NAME</i>.header: header template, printed once when the output file is opened; optional
	<li> <i>NAME</i>.footer: footer template, printed once when the output file is finished; optional
	<li> <i>NAME</i>.sort_id: used to render the "ID" string for each subcircuit; two subcircuits with matched ID are taken as the same type of component and is counted as a repetion (one item group); at the end items are alphabetically sorted by this ID
	<li> <i>NAME</i>.item: renders an output block (typically a single line) for an item group
	<li> <i>NAME</i>.footer: terminal template, printed once for each terminal within each subcircuit; optional
	<li> <i>NAME</i>.needs_escape: list all characters (as a string) that require escaping when printed with the "escape." prefix (see below)
	<li> <i>NAME</i>.escape: if specified, the first character of this string is used as the escape character; if not specified, offending characters are not escaped but replaced with an underscore
</ul>
<p>
Templates are text strings; they are printed as is, keeping all newlines and
whitespace. Portions in between % signs are substituted, depending on the
context.

<h4> 7.3.3.2. Substitution keywords </h4>
<p>
<table border=1>
	<tr><th> keyword                   <th> description
	<tr><td> %UTC%                     <td> current date and time in UTC
	<tr><td> %author%                  <td> board author
	<tr><td> %title%                   <td> board title
	<tr><td> %count%                   <td> integer value, number of subcircuits in the current item group
	<tr><td> %subc.a.KEY%              <td> take a subcircuit (randomly) from the current item group and print its attribute value of the attribute whose name matches KEY; print empty string for non-existing attributes (but this can be controlled by the | suffix operator)
	<tr><td> %subc.prefix%             <td> print the sequence of left side alhpanumeric characters of subc.a.refdes; e.g. "R" for "R14" and "CONN" for "CONN1"; typically <i>sort_id</i> starts with this so that the output us sorted by "component type" (as deduced from refdes prefix) first
</table>
<p>
Any of these may get an escape. prefix, , e.g. %escape.author% will print
the author with characters escaped. That means the resulting string
is checked for <i>needs_escape</i> character and are escaped using the
<i>escape</i> character. For example if the template contains:
<pre>
value="%subc.a.value%"
</pre>
<p>
and <i>needs_escape</i> contains the double quote character and <i>escape</i>
is a backslash and the subc's value attribute is <b>1/4" bolt</b>, the following
string is printed:
<pre>
value="1/4\" bolt"
</pre>
<p>
Or if <i>escape</i> is not specified:
<pre>
value="1/4_ bolt"
</pre>
<p>
Any substitution (e.g. "%foo%") may get an optional suffix operator:
<table border=1>
	<tr><td> %foo|unk%          <td> same as %foo% but print "unk" if <i>foo</i> evaluated to empty
	<tr><td> %foo?yes%          <td> same as %foo% but print "yes" if the value of <i>foo</i> represents true, "n/a" otherwise
	<tr><td> %foo?yes:nope%     <td> same as %foo% but print "yes" if the value of <i>foo</i> represents true, "nope" otherwise
</table>
<p>
For example %subc.a.hand_solder?hand solder:reflow% will look at the
valueof the subcircuit's <i>hand_solder</i> attribute; if it's true, yes, on or
1, "hand solder" is printed, else "reflow" is printed.

<h4> 7.3.3.3. Notes on sort_id </h4>
<p>
When subcircuits are first iterated, they are sorted into item groups by
their <i>sort_id</i> template. For each item group, only one subcircuit is
remembered, and only one block of info is printed.
<p>
In practice this means:
<ul>
	<li> <i>sort_id</i> affects which subcircuits are counted as one group
	<li> <i>sort_id</i> determines the order of output
	<li> <i>sort_id</i> shall contain every subcircuit attribute the <i>item</i> template is going to print
</ul>
<p>
The last is a requirement because if there is an attribute, e.g. foo, and
there are two subcircuits with different foo values and <i>sort_id</i>
does not contain %subc.a.foo%, the two subcircuits may end up in the same item
group. Then if <i>item</i> contains %subc.a.foo%, it can print only one value,
so it will choose one of the two randomly.
<p>
However if %subc.a.foo% is on the <i>sort_id</i> template, the two
subcircuits will yield different ID which means they never end up in the
same item group. This also means any item group will have only one value for
subc.a.foo in this case, so printing %subc.a.foo% from item will be
deterministic.
