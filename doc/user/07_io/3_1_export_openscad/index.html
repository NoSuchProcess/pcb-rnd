<h3> 7.2.1 export_openscad </h3>
<p>
The openscad exporter generates the 3D model of the board in form of 
an openscad script.
<p>
The main entry point of the script is pcb_board(). All coordinates are in
mm. The in x and y directions the 0;0 point of the board is the 0;0 point on
screen in pcb-rnd, to make it easy to wrap the board in a translate() after
measuring the coords of a point in pcb-rnd. The vertical origin is the middle
of the board's FR4.
<p>
Supported features:
<ul>
	<li> arbitrary shaped outline
	<li> top/bottom copper (optional)
	<li> top/bottom mask (optional)
	<li> top/bottom silk (optional)
	<li> holes (optional)
	<li> subcircuit (3d) models (optional)
</ul>

<p>
Subcircuit models are loaded from external files referenced from the subcircuit
in the pcb-rnd board file. Model files are searched recursively under the
footprint library search path.
<p>
The subcircuit (footprint instance) can have the following openscad related
attributes, all optional:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr><th>attrib                         <th> meaning
	<tr><td>openscad=filename              <td> file name of the .scad script (3d subcircuit model)
	<tr><td>openscad-transformation=script <td> apply the specified transformation on the model instance
	<tr><td>openscad-param=p1,p2,p3...     <td> parameters to pass on to the model
</table>
<p>
If the openscad attribute is not present, no 3d model is inserted.
<p>
If openscad-transformation is specified, it is inserted before the model
call; it typically contains a transform() and/or a rotate() to modify the
placement of the model. The 0;0;0 point of the placement is the origin of
the subcircuit in pcb-rnd, on the surface of the board. (Note: it is used to
match the model to the footprint; subcircuit rotation and translation are
automatically inserted by pcb-rnd on top of this. This attribute is empty
or not present when the model lines up with the neutral state of the footprint.)
<p>
If openscad-param is specified, the module is called with this parameter
list, else the model is called with empty parameter list.
<p>
A model file shall contain a single module, with "module" and the arbitrary
module name in the same line, { in the following line. One instance of
each model is copied into the output file so that the resulting openscad
script has no external reference and is self-contained.
