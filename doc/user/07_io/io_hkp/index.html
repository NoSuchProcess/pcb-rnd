<h3> 7.x.1. What is the HKP format? </h3>
<p>
HKP is Mentor Graphic's file format, <i>Hierarchical Keyword Parser</i>. A
set of HKP files can fully describe a board that can be exported from or
imported to Expedition PCB (old name: Veribest). In theory other
of their product would work with HKP files (such as PADS), but in practice
the actual import/export could be tricky. Also, discussions on
Mentor community forums show that the company started getting rid of the
ASCII HKP format around 2010 in favor of an encrypted and/or binary file format,
so an old version of the software or a special license with new versions might
be needed.
