Type: boards, footprints

<H3 autotoc="yes"> EasyEDA versions and compatibility </H3>
<p>
EasyEDA is an EDA tool for the schematics-pcb-simulation workflow. It is
proprietary but offers essentially unlimited free access both as an online
web service and an offline desktop software. As of 2024 neither the service
nor the software do too much to lock users in:
<ul>
	<li> design files are easy to download or upload
	<li> the native file formats are plain text or zipped plain text
	<li> there's even some minimal documentation on some of the native file formats
	<li> the software has alien format support
</ul>
<p>
EasyEDA alien format support may be of interest to Ringdove users because
EasyEDA is connected to:
<ul>
	<li> oshwlab: a community sharing open source hardware designs in EasyEDA
	     format; being able to load those schematics makes it easier to fork
	     them with free tools
	<li> lcsc: a generic electronics part vendor with a huge variety of parts;
	     besides datasheets, they also make symbols and footprints freely
	     downloadable for most of their parts - in EasyEDA format
	<li> jlcpcb: board fab and assembly shop; there seems to be some three-way
	     affiliation among EasyEDA, lcsc and jlcpcb, which suggests symbols/footprints
	     downloaded from lcsc would work well with the processes of jlc
</ul>
<p>
EasyEDA offers two variants, called <b>std</b> and <b>pro</b>. The two
variants are essentially two distinct software projects with
differing file formats and menus. Footprints present
in the part file downloaded from lcsc contains files,
in the pro format.
<p>
The file saved from pro is really a zip that has a project file, may
contain multiple PCBs and contains all necessary footprints as a local
lib (of separate files). The std format has single file boards (json)
with all footprints embedded.

<p>
pcb-rnd provides support for loading:
<ul>
	<li> std board file
	<li> std footprint (both from library anddirectly in footprint editor mode)
	<li> pro pcb project (one of the potentially multiple boards)
	<li> pro footprint (both from library and directly in footprint editor mode)
</ul>


<H3 autotoc="yes"> How to export from EasyEDA </H3>
<p>
Before trying any of these, make sure you use the right variant (std or pro),
the user interface and file formats really differ a lot.
<p>
<ul>
	<li> <b>std board</b> from the online editor: File menu, File source...,
	     download button; saves a json that contains the board with all
	     footprints embedded
	<li> <b>std footprint</b> from the online editor <b>from sheet</b>: click on
	     the "library" icon on the left, this should bring up a library dialog
	     that lists all parts (symbol+footprint) used on the board; select
	     a part; click on the footprint preview on the right side of the window;
	     this will open a new tab with the footprint; File menu, view source the
	     click the download button.
	<li> <b>pro board</b> from the online editor: File menu, Project save as (local);
	     saves a zip file named *.epro.
	<li> <b>pro footprint</b> from the online editor from a board: select the
	     footprint on the board, right click, edit footprint, "apply only selected...",
	     "yes" on the popup; this opens a new tab with the footprint; File menu,
	     view source the click the download button.
	<li> <b>pro footprint from lcsc</b>: navigate to the product detail page of the part,
	     there should be an EasyEDA model link under the datasheet link;
	     clicking that opens a preview; click "free trial" there and the
	     file opens in the online editor; select the footprint tab; File menu,
	     File source..., Download button; saves a text file starting with
	     <i>["DOCTYPE","FOOTPRINT",...</i>; copy this file into the library,
	     start pcb-rnd, open library window: the symbol should show up in
	     the list
</ul>

<H3 autotoc="yes"> Alien format limitations </H3>
<p>
There are some details that are not imported; the data model and the logics
of the software differ, so there are some manual editing steps needed after
loading alien format data. Below is a list of known cases for EasyEDA.

<H4 autotoc="yes"> Color </H4>
<p>
Layer color import depends on the config nodes plugins.io_easyeda.load_color_*;
it is possible to import all EasyEDA layer colros or no EasyEDA colors or
importing colors for certain layer types only.

<H4 autotoc="yes"> Text alignment and size </H4>
<p>
Font differs a lot between EasyEDA and pcb-rnd. Text objects are generally
placed where they should be, but their size may differ. Multiline text
objects are not supported in pcb-rnd (as of 2024).

<H4 autotoc="yes"> Multi-board bundles </H4>
<p>
An EasyEDA pro project files may contain multiple board files. Pcb-rnd can
load only one board file for editing. There are two ways of controlling
which board of a multi-board project is loaded:
<ul>
	<li> if the config node plugins/io_easyeda/load_board_name is set, pcb-rnd will look for a matching board name and load only that file (this is case sensitive 1:1 matching)
	<li> else in interactive GUI mode a dialog is present with the board names and the user can select one
	<li> in non-gui mode if the board name is not set, the load fails.
</ul>

<H4 autotoc="yes"> Terminal connection sensitivity </H4>
<p>
In EasyEDA there's a single point, typically the outer endpoint, of the terminal
that is sensitive to wire and terminal connections. In sch-rnd the whole
terminal is sensitive. EasyEDA wires crossing the insensitive middle
section of a terminal are connected to the terminal when importing the
file in sch-rnd and upon compilation a multi-connection warning is generated
unless it is disabled.

<H4 autotoc="yes"> pro: Clearance on "pours" </H4>
<p>
The POUR object has either a direct, hardwired rule to use for determining the
clearance (it's the "custom" rule in EasyEDA GUI) or a "network based"
mechanism, through complicated RULE_SELECTOR lines. pcb-rnd supports the
former but not the latter. For any net-based poly clearance a hardwired
value of 5 mil is used and a warning is thrown.
<p>
pcb-rnd's clearance model differs a lot from EasyEDA's. The closest thing
pcb-rnd can do is using polygon-side clearances, so on EasyEDA imports:
<ul>
	<li> non-poly drawing objects (lines, arcs, padstacks) get a very small non-zero clearance value so that they clear
	<li> polygons get the clear flag and a polygon-enforced clearance deducied from rules attached to the polygon's source object (see above)
	<li> no connection/thermal is made (it's network-based nn EasyEDA)
</ul>

<H4 autotoc="yes"> keepout/keepaway not loaded </H4>
<p>
EasyEDA has special objects for representing restrictions. While pcb-rnd
has enough features to represent most of the keepouts, currently the plugin
is not loading this information.

<H4 autotoc="yes"> pro: physical layer stackup </H4>
<p>
EasyEDA stores properties of physical layers (material, thicnkess); pcb-rnd
can represent similar properties but the plugin does not load these.

<H4 autotoc="yes"> DIMENSION </H4>
<p>
EasyEDA has a complex object type called DIMENSION which displays a dimension
line with the length printed. pcb-rnd has a similar extended object. The
plugin's std loader loads the DIMENSION object but places static objects instead
of an extended object (so the result looks like in EasyEDA but is not easily
editable in pcb-rnd). The pro loader ignores DIMENSION objects.


<H4 autotoc="yes"> How unzipping works </H4>
<p>
I decided not to introduce a libzip dependency, rather just call unzip as
an external utility. Any zip implementation can be used as long as it
provides two functionality:
<ul>
	<li> given a full path to a zip file, prints a file list to stdout (in whatever text format)
	<li> given a full path to a zip file, extracts all files into the current working directory
</ul>
<p>
For example on Debian-like systems the packgae <b>unzip</b> can do these.
<p>
The actual command lines for these two functions are configured, see
config nodes <b>plugins/easyeda/zip_extract_cmd</b> and
<b>plugins/easyeda/zip_list_cmd</b>; %s is substituted with the full path
of the zip file and CWD is set before calling the extract command.
<p>
This is a weak dependency: any of these is required only if pro files are to
be open. Manually unzipped board files can not be loaded (but footprints can be).
