<h2> 3. Where Data Is Stored </h2>
<p>
Pcb-rnd enables the user to design complex original boards in a standard EDA
flow with netlists and other data inputs that aide in design. pcb-rnd also
acts as a multiuse layout design CAD, opening board designs saved in a variety
of legacy and contemporary software.
<p>
The user can import a variety of non-layout data sources commonly used in EDA
flow. Schematics from gschem or kicad, netlists, reference images, tinyCAD,
and more are available to the user.

<h3> 3.1. Board </h3>
<p>
pcb-rnd can edit a single board at a time. To edit multiple boards, open
multiple instances of pcb-rnd.

<h3> 3.2. Paste Buffer</h3>
There are multiple paste buffers available in pcb-rnd. The user can select
one of them to be active - most buffer operations will work with the active
buffer.
<p>
Buffers are board-independent: they have their own dynamic size and their
own virtual layer stack. These enable buffers to act as a proxy between
different boards with different properties.
<p>
The following operations can be done with buffers:
<ul>
	<li> clear: the content of the buffer is discarded
	<li> copy from layout: copy objects from the layout to the buffer
	<li> paste to layout: copy objects from the buffer to the layout
	<li> load: load buffer from file (including footprints/subcircuits from the library)
	<li> save subcircuit: save elements/subcircuits from buffer to file
	<li> build a subcircuit in a buffer, from the objects stored in the buffer
	<li> build a padstack in a buffer, from the objects stored in the buffer
	<li> break up a subcircuit in a buffer
<!--	<li> break up a padstack in a buffer -->
	<li> rotate
	<li> mirror
</ul>

<h3> 3.3. Footprint Libraries</h3>
<h4> 3.3.1. Library handling </h4>
<p>
A footprint library is a collection of subcircuit files, optionally
equipped with metadata. A footprint library is stored and accessed by
footprint plugins (whose names are conventionally prefixed with fp_).
Where the actual data is stored, how and when it is retrieved depends
on the fp_ plugin.
<p>
There is a configuration node called <i>rc/library_search_paths</i> which
is a list of footprint library search paths. How each path is interpreted
also depends on the fp_ plugins.
<p>
Currently pcb-rnd offers the following fp_ plugins:
<table border=1>
	<tr><th>plugin <th> description <th> library_search_paths example
	<tr><td>fp_fs
		<td> list and load files from directories on the host file system
		<td> ~/my_lib <br> /usr/lib/company_lib <br> $(rc.path.share)/pcblib
	<tr><td>fp_board
		<td> extract all footprints from an existing board file (given in
		     any board format pcb-rnd can load) and use these footprints as
		     a library
		<td> board@/home/joe/ee/control/cpu.lht
	<tr><td>fp_wget
		<td> download a digested map of a footprint library from a web server,
		     using wget; make all footprints and metadata available in the
		     library but do not immediately download footprint files; keep
		     a local (host file system) cache of footprints accessed. Currently
		     supports <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/edakrill">edakrill</a>
		     and <a href="http://www.gedasymbols.org">gedasymbols</a>.
		<td> wget@edakrill <br> wget@gedasymbols

<h4> 3.3.2. footprint types </h4>
<p>
There are two types of footprints:
<ul>
	<li> static (file) footprints; and
	<li> parametric (generated) footprints.
</ul>
<p>
A static footprint is a data file that is loaded and parsed by one of
the io_ plugins. pcb-rnd supports multiple file formats: the native lihata
subcircuit format, kicad, eagle, gEDA footprints.
<p>
A parametric footprint is an external program or script that is executed
by pcb-rnd. The external program shall write a valid footprint file to its
standard output, which is then parsed and used the same way as in case of
static footprints. The external program gets a list of parameters
extracted from the footprint name by pcb-rnd.
<p>
The basic syntax for a parametric footprint is <i>name(arg1, arg2, ...
argN)</i>. Any footprint name that contains a '(' is treated as parametric.
The list of arguments is separated by commas. How arguments are interpreted,
e.g. whether the are positional or named or both, is up to the external
parametric footprint program.
<p>
The footprint programs are stored in the library tree, and are accessed
using the fp_ plugins. There is no limitation on how the program is implemented
other than the host operating system on which pcb-rnd runs has to be able to
execute it.


<h3> 3.4. file formats</h3>
<p>
pcb-rnd operates on an in-memory data tree of the board while it is being edited.
The in-memory data tree can not be dumped in a file without conversion: loading
any file means converting the given file format to the in-memory representation
and saving from memory to any file format is just another conversion.

<p>
Lossless save/load round trips for all pcb-rnd features are guaranteed
only when using the latest version of the native formats. The reason is
that the native formats are always upgraded to support all features of
the in-memory data model. It is possible (but not recommended) to use
older versions of the native formats to retrain compatibility with older
versions of pcb-rnd.

<p>
The <i>native</i> file formats of pcb-rnd are:
<ul>
	<li> lihata board for PCBs
	<li> lihata subcircuit for footprints
	<li> lihata based pcb-rnd-conf for configuration data
</ul>

<p>
Non-native file formats are called <i>alien</i> formats. pcb-rnd supports
a large variety of alien formats, but lossless save/load round trips are
not guaranteed when alien formats are used. The code will always do its best
to get good results, but different alien formats have different features,
and most of them can not fully capture all features pcb-rnd offers.

<p id="io">
Some alien formats are implemented as io_ plugins and are accessible
as normal board (and footprint) file formats directly from the load/save
infrastructure and footprint library. These formats are trying to capture
all details of the board (or footprint) and are usually close to
producing lossless save/load round trips. 

<p>
Other alien formats are supported through import_ or export_ plugins.
These formats do not capture enough aspects of a board (or footprint) to
be used as a full load or save, round trip of any sort is impossible.

<p>
Typical export example is render outputs: png, ps, gerber are all
export_ plugins: they export one aspect (geometry and sometimes layering)
of the board, but do not export other aspects such as connections,
subcircuits or padstack structure. Lacking that information, the exported
board can never be loaded as a board from png, ps or gerber.

<p>
Typical import example is netlist (or schematics): it deals with one aspect
of the project, connection info, and lacks any physical information such
as geometry or layers. It is possible to import one aspect of the design from
a netlist (or schematics), but it is not possible to reconstruct a full board
using only the netlist information.
