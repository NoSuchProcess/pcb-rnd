<h1> pcb-rnd - user manual </h1>

<h2> 3. Where Data Is Stored </h2>
<p>
Pcb-rnd enables the user to design complex original boards in a standard EDA
flow with netlists and other data inputs that aide in design. pcb-rnd also
acts as a multiuse layout design CAD, opening board designs saved in a variety
of legacy and contemporary software.
<p>
The user can import a variety of non-layout data sources commonly used in EDA
flow. Schematics from gschem or kicad, netlists, reference images, tinyCAD,
and more are available to the user.

<h3> 3.1. Board </h3>
<p>
pcb-rnd can edit a single board at a time. To edit multiple boards, open
multiple instances of pcb-rnd.

<h3> 3.2. Paste Buffer</h3>
There are multiple paste buffers available in pcb-rnd. The user can select
one of them to be active - most buffer operations will work with the active
buffer.
<p>
Buffers are board-independent: they have their own dynamic size and their
own virtual layer stack. These enable buffers to act as a proxy between
different boards with different properties.
<p>
The following operations can be done with buffers:
<ul>
	<li> clear: the content of the buffer is discarded
	<li> copy from layout: copy objects from the layout to the buffer
	<li> paste to layout: copy objects from the buffer to the layout
	<li> load: load buffer from file (including footprints/subcircuits from the library)
	<li> save element/subcircuit: save elements/subcircuits from buffer to file
	<li> build a subcircuit in a buffer, from the objects stored in the buffer
	<li> build a padstack in a buffer, from the objects stored in the buffer
	<li> break up a subcircuit in a buffer
<!--	<li> break up a padstack in a buffer -->
	<li> rotate
	<li> mirror
</ul>
