<h1> pcb-rnd - user manual </h1>

<h2> 3. Where Data Is Stored </h2>
<p>
Pcb-rnd enables the user to design complex original boards in a standard EDA
flow with netlists and other data inputs that aide in design. pcb-rnd also
acts as a multiuse layout design CAD, opening board designs saved in a variety
of legacy and contemporary software.
<p>
The user can import a variety of non-layout data sources commonly used in EDA
flow. Schematics from gschem or kicad, netlists, reference images, tinyCAD,
and more are available to the user.

<h3> 3.1. Board </h3>
<p>
pcb-rnd can edit a single board at a time. To edit multiple boards, open
multiple instances of pcb-rnd.

<h3> 3.2. Paste Buffer</h3>
There are multiple paste buffers available in pcb-rnd. The user can select
one of them to be active - most buffer operations will work with the active
buffer.
<p>
Buffers are board-independent: they have their own dynamic size and their
own virtual layer stack. These enable buffers to act as a proxy between
different boards with different properties.
<p>
The following operations can be done with buffers:
<ul>
	<li> clear: the content of the buffer is discarded
	<li> copy from layout: copy objects from the layout to the buffer
	<li> paste to layout: copy objects from the buffer to the layout
	<li> load: load buffer from file (including footprints/subcircuits from the library)
	<li> save element/subcircuit: save elements/subcircuits from buffer to file
	<li> build a subcircuit in a buffer, from the objects stored in the buffer
	<li> build a padstack in a buffer, from the objects stored in the buffer
	<li> break up a subcircuit in a buffer
<!--	<li> break up a padstack in a buffer -->
	<li> rotate
	<li> mirror
</ul>

<h3> 3.3. Footprint Libraries</h3>
<h4> 3.3.1. Library handling </h4>
<p>
A footprint library is a collection of subcircuit files, optionally
equipped with metadata. A footprint library is stored and accessed by
footprint plugins (whose names are conventionally prefixed with fp_).
Where the actual data is stored, how and when it is retrieved depends
on the fp_ plugin.
<p>
There is a configuration node called <i>rc/library_search_paths</i> which
is a list of footprint library search paths. How each path is interpreted
also depends on the fp_ plugins.
<p>
Currently pcb-rnd offers the following fp_ plugins:
<table border=1>
	<tr><th>plugin <th> description <th> library_search_paths example
	<tr><td>fp_fs
		<td> list and load files from directories on the host file system
		<td> ~/my_lib <br> /usr/lib/company_lib <br> $(rc.path.share)/pcblib
	<tr><td>fp_board
		<td> extract all footprints from an existing board file (given in
		     any board format pcb-rnd can load) and use these footprints as
		     a library
		<td> board@/home/joe/ee/control/cpu.lht
	<tr><td>fp_wget
		<td> download a digested map of a footprint library from a web server,
		     using wget; make all footprints and metadata available in the
		     library but do not immediately download footprint files; keep
		     a local (host file system) cache of footprints accessed. Currently
		     supports <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/edakrill">edakrill</a>
		     and <a href="http://www.gedasymbols.org">gedasymbols</a>.
		<td> wget@edakrill <br> wget@gedasymbols
</table>

<h4> 3.3.2. footprint types </h4>
<p>
There are two types of footprints:
<ul>
	<li> static (file) footprints; and
	<li> parametric (generated) footprints.
</ul>
<p>
A static footprint is a data file that is loaded and parsed by one of
the io_ plugins. pcb-rnd supports multiple file formats: the native lihata
subcircuit format, kicad, eagle, gEDA footprints.
<p>
A parametric footprint is an external program or script that is executed
by pcb-rnd. The exteran program shall write a valid footprint file to its
standard output, which is then parsed and used the same way as in case of
static footprints. The external program gets a list of parameters
extracted from the footprint name by pcb-rnd.
<p>
The basic syntax for a parametric footprint is <i>name(arg1, arg2, ...
argN)<i>. Any footprint name that contains a '(' is treated as parametric.
The list of arguments is separated by commas. How arguments are interpreted,
e.g. whether the are positional or named or both, is up to the external
parametric footprint program.
<p>
The footprint programs are stored in the library tree, and are accessed
using the fp_ plugins. There is no limitation on how the program is implemented
other than the host operating system on which pcb-rnd runs has to be able to
execute it.
