<h2> 6.1. keyboard bindings </h2>
<p>
The same default menu file is used in all GUI HIDs. It comes with multi-stroke
key bindings, plus only a very few, alternative keys that use modifiers
(mostly ctrl). A multi-stroke key binding requires the user to type in a
sequence of keys, e.g. pressing 't' and 'l' (written as {t l} in this document)
will make pcb-rnd switch to the line tool. There are two major advanatges of
using multi-stroke instead of modifiers:
<ul>
	<li> It is often easier to remember them, e.g. the above {t l} can be
	     memorized as 'tool, line', and it is similar to {t a} for 'tool, arc'
	     and {t, p} for 'tool, polygon'. The old menu file had these as F2, F3
	     and F6. They could be also ctrl+l, ctrl+a, ctrl+p, but then if another
	     group of functionality required similar letters, like l for list or
	     p for print, they would ned to use a different modifier, e.g. alt+l
	     and alt+p. At the end there would be a random set of alt, ctrl, shift
	     combinations that are real hard to remember - this is exactly how
	     the old (pre-2.0.0) default menu file was.
	<li> Since pcb-rnd is a graphical CAD, the mouse is an inportant user input
	     device. Most users will have one hand constantly on the mouse. It is much
	     faster to type a sequence of 2 or rarely 3 plain keys with one hand than
	     doing the acrobatics for something like ctrl+t or even alt+shif+u.
</ul>
<p>
Most multi-stroke keys, especially the commonly used ones, use two strokes.
Some rarely used feature will require three. The system can be regarded
as a tree: e.g. in a 3-key sequence, starting from the root
(nothing is pressed) the first key select a chapter, the second
key narrows it down to a subchapter and the third key (leaf) selects the actual
action within the subchapter. The <a href="keytree.svg">current key tree</a> is
accessible in a large svg drawing or in a script-digestable
<a href="keytree.txt">flat list</a>.

<h2> 6.2. Grid </h2>
<p id="grid">
The grid is an imaginary set of points over the drawing. The crosshair
can snap to the grid, helping the user to keep coordinates of objects
distributed evenly.
<p>
The only grid geometr pcb-rnd supports is a regular, rectangular grid, that
is: grid points spaced evenly in x and y directions, aligned into horizontal
and vertical rows. The grid also has an optional offset in x and y directions
(which is usually set to 0;0).
<p>
The grid spacing (distance between grid points) is user configurable. There
are two methods managing the grid.

<h3> 6.2.1. Preset grid </h3>

<p>
The configuration system has a node called editor/grids, which is an ordered
list of <i>preset</i> grid settings. This list should contain the grid settings
preferred by the user, or preferred for the given design. Since this is a
configuration item, the usual conf rules apply (e.g. local grid config
can be saved in the project's config or even in the board file).
<p>
While drawing, the user can use the {g b} and {g f} hotkeys, or the shorter
[ and ] keys to <i>step</i> the current grid, selecting the previous or next item
from the list. The grid sizes menu will always have the currently selected
item checked.
<p>
<img src="grid_menu.png">
<p>
If the user changes grid properties directly, the new grid setup will most
likely not match any of the presets and the check mark is gone from the menu.
However, pcb-rnd remember the last used preset menu and upon the next
<i>stepping</i> it will move from the last selected preset grid.

<p>
The format for the grid configuration is a simple text that lists an
optional grid name, the mandatory grid size, the optional offset and
optionally instructs pcb-rnd to also switch units when the grid is activated.
The full syntax, optional parts written in [] is:
<pre>
[name:]size[@offs][!unit]
</pre>
<p>
(The optional name has no functionality other than being displayed, helping
the user to remember the purpose of the grid.)

<p>
Examples:
<p>
<table border=1>
	<tr><th> grid spec                           <th> description
	<tr><td> <pre>10 mil</pre>                   <td> anonymous 10 mil grid with no offset
	<tr><td> <pre>1.5 mm</pre>                   <td> anonymous 1.5 mm grid with no offset
	<tr><td> <pre>20 mil@1mil;-3mil</pre>        <td> 20 mil grid with a horizontal offset of +1 mil and vertical offset of -3 mil
	<tr><td> <pre>1.5 mm!mm</pre>                <td> 1.5 mm grid; when activated, switch untis to mm
	<tr><td> <pre>placing dips:100 mil</pre>     <td> named grid
	<tr><td> <pre>leds:1mm@0.5mm;-0.1mm!mm</pre> <td> all the above features, combined
</table>

<h3> 6.2.2. Custom grid </h3>
<p>
The current grid is stored as grid distance and x;y offset. Regardless of
the configured presets, these properties of the current grid can be changed
any time, using the SetValue() action or using the menu.
