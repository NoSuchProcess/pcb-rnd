<h1> pcb-rnd - user manual </h1>

<h2> 6.1 keyboard bindings </h2>
<p>
The same default menu file is used in all GUI HIDs. It comes with multi-stroke
key bindings, plus only a very few, alternative keys that use modifiers
(mostly ctrl). A multi-stroke key binding requires the user to type in a
sequence of keys, e.g. pressing 't' and 'l' (written as {t l} in this document)
will make pcb-rnd switch to the line tool. There are two major advanatges of
using multi-stroke instead of modifiers:
<ul>
	<li> It is often easier to remember them, e.g. the above {t l} can be
	     memorized as 'tool, line', and it is similar to {t a} for 'tool, arc'
	     and {t, p} for 'tool, polygon'. The old menu file had these as F2, F3
	     and F6. They could be also ctrl+l, ctrl+a, ctrl+p, but then if another
	     group of functionality required similar letters, like l for list or
	     p for print, they would ned to use a different modifier, e.g. alt+l
	     and alt+p. At the end there would be a random set of alt, ctrl, shift
	     combinations that are real hard to remember - this is exactly how
	     the old (pre-2.0.0) default menu file was.
	<li> Since pcb-rnd is a graphical CAD, the mouse is an inportant user input
	     device. Most users will have one hand constantly on the mouse. It is much
	     faster to type a sequence of 2 or rarely 3 plain keys with one hand than
	     doing the acrobatics for something like ctrl+t or even alt+shif+u.
</ul>
<p>
Most multi-stroke keys, especially the commonly used ones, use two strokes.
Some rarely used feature will require three. The system can be regarded
as a tree: e.g. in a 3-key sequence, starting from the root
(nothing is pressed) the first key select a chapter, the second
key narrows it down to a subchapter and the third key (leaf) selects the actual
action within the subchapter. The <a href="keytree.svg">current key tree</a> is
accessible in a large svg drawing or in a script-digestable
<a href="keytree.txt">flat list</a>.
