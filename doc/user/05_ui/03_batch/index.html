<h2> 5.3 Batch User Interface</h2>

<p>
Pcb-rnd comes with a interpreter which is known as the batch UI. This batch UI
is a default buildin and can be summond at any time when running pcb-rnd (see
code below). Batch mode will compile and run as the default user interface when pcb-rnd is
compiled on systems without any GUI libs installed.

<p>
The batch UI is useful for automation, test, and debugging: it is reading
action commands on the standard input and prints results on the standard
output. It does not run a GUI and does not require X. Typical invocation:
<p>
<code>
./pcb-rnd --gui batch [path]
</code>

<p>
Uses and examples for Batch mode (TODO):
<ul>
<li>automation
<li>export footprint  (with additional plugins)
<li>possible hook processing (ensuring consistent layout state for a dvcs)
</ul>
