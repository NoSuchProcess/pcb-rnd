<h2> 5.4. pcb-rnd GUI (common) </h2>

<h3> 5.4.1. keyboard bindings </h3>
<p>
The same default menu file is used in all GUI HIDs. It comes with multi-stroke
key bindings, plus only a very few, alternative keys that use modifiers
(mostly ctrl). A multi-stroke key binding requires the user to type in a
sequence of keys, e.g. pressing 't' and 'l' (written as {t l} in this document)
will make pcb-rnd switch to the line tool. There are two major advantages of
using multi-stroke instead of modifiers:
<ul>
	<li> It is often easier to remember them, e.g. the above {t l} can be
	     memorized as 'tool, line', and it is similar to {t a} for 'tool, arc'
	     and {t, p} for 'tool, polygon'. The old menu file had these as F2, F3
	     and F6. They could be also ctrl+l, ctrl+a, ctrl+p, but then if another
	     group of functionality required similar letters, like l for list or
	     p for print, they would need to use a different modifier, e.g. alt+l
	     and alt+p. At the end there would be a random set of alt, ctrl, shift
	     combinations that are real hard to remember - this is exactly how
	     the old (pre-2.0.0) default menu file was.
	<li> Since pcb-rnd is a graphical CAD, the mouse is an important user input
	     device. Most users will have one hand constantly on the mouse. It is much
	     faster to type a sequence of 2 or rarely 3 plain keys with one hand than
	     doing the acrobatics for something like ctrl+t or even alt+shif+u.
</ul>
<p>
Most multi-stroke keys, especially the commonly used ones, use two strokes.
Some rarely used feature will require three. The system can be regarded
as a tree: e.g. in a 3-key sequence, starting from the root
(nothing is pressed) the first key select a chapter, the second
key narrows it down to a subchapter and the third key (leaf) selects the actual
action within the subchapter. The <a href="keytree.svg">current key tree</a> is
accessible in a large svg drawing or in a script-digestible
<a href="keytree.txt">flat list</a>.

<h3> 5.4.2 Grid </h3>
<p id="grid">
The grid is an imaginary set of points over the drawing. The crosshair
can snap to the grid, helping the user to keep coordinates of objects
distributed evenly.
<p>
The only grid geometry pcb-rnd supports is a regular, rectangular grid, that
is: grid points spaced evenly in x and y directions, aligned into horizontal
and vertical rows. The grid also has an optional offset in x and y directions
(which is usually set to 0;0).
<p>
The grid spacing (distance between grid points) is user configurable. There
are two methods managing the grid.

<h3> 5.4.3. Preset grid </h3>

<p>
The configuration system has a node called editor/grids, which is an ordered
list of <i>preset</i> grid settings. This list should contain the grid settings
preferred by the user, or preferred for the given design. Since this is a
configuration item, the usual conf rules apply (e.g. local grid config
can be saved in the project's config or even in the board file).
<p>
While drawing, the user can use the {g b} and {g f} hotkeys, or the shorter
[ and ] keys to <i>step</i> the current grid, selecting the previous or next item
from the list. The grid sizes menu will always have the currently selected
item checked.
<p>
<img src="grid_menu.png">
<p>
If the user changes grid properties directly, the new grid setup will most
likely not match any of the presets and the check mark is gone from the menu.
However, pcb-rnd remember the last used preset menu and upon the next
<i>stepping</i> it will move from the last selected preset grid.

<p>
The format for the grid configuration is a simple text that lists an
optional grid name, the mandatory grid size, the optional offset and
optionally instructs pcb-rnd to also switch units when the grid is activated.
The full syntax, optional parts written in [] is:
<pre>
[name:]size[@offs][!unit]
</pre>
<p>
(The optional name has no functionality other than being displayed, helping
the user to remember the purpose of the grid.)

<p>
Examples:
<p>
<table border=1>
	<tr><th> grid spec                           <th> description
	<tr><td> <pre>10 mil</pre>                   <td> anonymous 10 mil grid with no offset
	<tr><td> <pre>1.5 mm</pre>                   <td> anonymous 1.5 mm grid with no offset
	<tr><td> <pre>20 mil@1mil;-3mil</pre>        <td> 20 mil grid with a horizontal offset of +1 mil and vertical offset of -3 mil
	<tr><td> <pre>1.5 mm!mm</pre>                <td> 1.5 mm grid; when activated, switch untis to mm
	<tr><td> <pre>placing dips:100 mil</pre>     <td> named grid
	<tr><td> <pre>leds:1mm@0.5mm;-0.1mm!mm</pre> <td> all the above features, combined
</table>

<h3> 5.4.4. Custom grid </h3>
<p>
The current grid is stored as grid distance and x;y offset. Regardless of
the configured presets, these properties of the current grid can be changed
any time, using the SetValue() action or using the menu.


<h3 id="menu"> 5.4.5. The extensible menu system </h3>

<h4> 5.4.5.1. Menu files, patches and sources </h4>
<p>
The menu system is loaded and merged from multiple menu files and is dynamic
(can be changed while pcb-rnd is running). There is a base menu file
(file name is partially configured by conf node rc/menu_file), typically
/usr/share/pcb-menu-default.lht. This is file is loaded first, with priority 0.
Then pcb-rnd loads further menu files and menu file patches, for feature plugins,
scripts or user addons at higher priority.
<p>
All menu files and menu patches are kept in memory. Upon loading,
unloading or modifying any of these in-memory menu images, pcb-rnd will
merge them into the final menu tree, which is what the GUI menu layout is
modified to.
<p>
The following menu file/patch sources are supported:
<p>
<table border=1>
	<tr><th> source            <th> usual prio    <th> description
	<tr><td> base              <td> 0             <td> factory menu file, normally /usr/share/pcb-menu-default.lht
	<tr><td> plugins (static)  <td> 100..199      <td> menu files embedded in feature plugins (e.g. to create import menus per format)
	<tr><td> user              <td> 300..400      <td> menu files/patches loaded upon user request (conf node: rc/menu_patches)
	<tr><td> action (scripts)  <td> 500           <td> using the CreateMenu() action
	<tr><td> plugins (dynamic) <td> 500           <td> e.g. route style or layer menus that are generated from board data
</table>

<h4 id="menu_patches"> 5.4.5.2. Menu files vs. menu patches </h4>
<p>
Menu files describe the 
<a href="../../../developer/lihata_format/tree.html#/lht_tree_doc/roots/menu">
menu tree</a>, or a part of the menu tree, in its final
form. The base of the menu system, at priority 0, must be a menu file. When
a menu file is used to patch an existing in-memory menu image (at priority
higher than 0), it can overwrite existing parts of the image or it can
append to existing menus and submenus. But it can not remove submenus or
modify existing submenus without fully overwriting them. The root node
of a menu file is ha:rnd-menu-v1.
<p>
A <a href="../../../developer/lihata_format/tree.html#/lht_tree_doc/roots/menu_patch">
menu patch </a>
file contains an ordered list of instructions on how to
make modifications to the current in-memory menu image. The menu patch
file is a lihata document as follows:
<pre>
ha:rnd-menu-patch-v1 {
	prio=456
	li:patch {
		<i>...instructions (see below)...</i>
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
The priority value is optional; when specified, it is used to position the
patch in the order of merging. Instructions are executed in the order they
are specified in the file.
<p>
An instruction can be one of these:
<p>
<ul>
<li> a. append_menu:
<pre>
ha:append_menu {
 path = /main_menu/File/Reports
 li:submenu {
  ha:foobar  = { a={&lt;key&gt;i;&lt;key&gt;5}; action=wow() }
 }
}
</pre>
<p>Appends (or overwrites) items under the menu path specified in <i>path</i>, with
the menu subtree taken from the <i>submenu</i> node. The structure of the submenu
node matches the structure of the plain menu file. The capabilities of this
instruction is similar to a plain menu file's; the reason for using this
variant is that it can be part of a menu patch instruction list.

<li> b. remove_menu:
<pre>
ha:remove_menu {
 path = /main_menu/File/Reports/Generate drill summary
}
</pre>
<p>
Removes a menu or a whole menu subtree at the specified path, if it exists
(no error or warning is generated when it does not).

<li> c. overwrite_menu_props:
<pre>
ha:overwrite_menu_props {
 path = /main_menu/File/Reports/Report found padstacks
 ha:props { a={&lt;key&gt;i;ctrl&lt;key&gt;1};}
}

</pre>
<p>
If the menu path specified in <i>path</i> exists and is a plain submenu item,
its properties specified in <i>props</i> are overwritten. If a property is
not present in the original menu node, it is added. The above example replaces
the hotkey of an existing menu item. If the menu node at the given path is not
found, the instruction is silently ignored.


<h4> 5.4.5.3. The merge process </h4>
<p>
Pcb-rnd maintains a list of menu files and menu patches ordered by priority.
Any change to this list triggers a menu merge. In the menu merge a new lihata
document is created in-memory (called the <i>menu image</i>). This document
is initially the copy of the base menu file (priority 0 on the list). Then
each menu file/patch is taken, in ascending order by priority and is applied
to the menu image. Plain menu files simply append/overwrite subtrees, menu
patch files are interpreted and executed instruction by instruction. Each menu
file/patch manipulates the menu image as-is at the moment the file/patch is
applied - that is, modified by previously applied files/patches.
<p>
Once the merge process finished, the new menu image is ready. It is compared
with the last menu image and differences are used to update the GUI so that
the menu system will reflect the content of the new menu image by updating
from the previous image with the least number of steps.
Once the GUI menu update process finishes, the old menu image is discarded
as the new menu image is in effect.

<h4> 5.4.5.4. User interface </h4>
<p>
Menu files and menu patches are created and edited using a text editor.
<p>
The list of menu files loaded at the moment can be viewed on the menu
tab of the preferences window or can be printed using the following
action:
<pre>
MenuPatch(list)
</pre>
<p>
Menu files/patches can be loaded and unloaded manually; even those can
be unloaded that are created by feature plugins. Such operation is possible
both from the preferences window and from the MenuPatch action. These modifications
however affect only the in-memory list of files/patches and are not permanent.
<p>
To permanently add user supplied menu files/patches, typically to change
hotkeys or create new menu items, the following process should be followed:
<ul>
	<li> 1. create the menu file/patch using a text editor
	<li> 2. use the preferences window or a text editor to modify the config node rc/menu_patches
	<li> 3. pcb-rnd will automatically update the in-memory menu file/patch list and will redo the menu merging once the config node is modified
</ul>

<h4> 5.4.5.5. Menu file layout </h4>
<p>
A menu file has the following main trees:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> <i>li:mouse</i> defines the mouse bindings
	<li> <i>li:toolbar_static</i> specifies the static part of the toolbar (the "left side"; plugins can still add anything not listed here and those will end up in the dynamic section on the right end in random order)
	<li> <i>li:main_menu</i> the menu tree for the main menu of the top window
	<li> <i>li:popups</i> named popup menu trees; each child is the root of an independent popup menu that is invoked by name
	<li> <i>li:scripts</i> named action scripts that can be symlinked from any of the above trees so long scripts don't scatter single-line menu item descriptions
	<li> <i>li:anchored</i> each item is a ha:@anchor { li:submenu { ... } }, where @anchor refers to anchor(s) placed in the tree, by name; the content of the submenu is copied after each instance of the anchor in the main_menu or plugins tree
</ul>

<h4> 5.4.5.6. Separators and anchors </h4>
<p>
If a submenu item is a text node with a plain dash ("-") as value, it will
appear as a horizontal separator line in the menu.
<p>
If a submenu item is a text node with a text starting with the character @,
it is a named anchor. An anchor is invisible placeholder. Plugins and scripts
and user menu files may refer to these anchors from their <i>anchored</i>
subtree to get submenus placed at specific (named) parts of the menu system
without having to hardwire a path to those parts. The same anchor name may
appear multiple times. Anchors are allowed only under the main_menu and popups
tree.
