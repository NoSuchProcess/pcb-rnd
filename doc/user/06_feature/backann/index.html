<h2 autotoc="yes"> Back annotation </h2>
<p>
<h3> Theory of operation </h3>
<p>
<i>Forward annotation</i> is when the schematics editor exports a full
"current state" of the project in a netlist and pcb-rnd loads that. On
pcb-rnd side this is called <i>import schematics</i> or <i>import
netlist</i> (the latter loads connectivity information only, the former
connectivity and a lot of metadata like footprints and component values).
<p>
After a forward annotation, pcb-rnd will be in sync about the "current state"
of the project. The user will go on editing; most changes that are
in-line with the imported netlist/schematics (the rats nest will guarantee
that). There may be mistakes, for example accidentally shorting two nets;
these are changes contradicting the imported netlist. This is also detected
by the rats nest code in pcb-rnd and a short circuit warning is generated.
(Note: the user needs to invoke the check manually, e.g. using the hotkey
{c r}).
<p>
For pcb-rnd to be able to perform the check any time, the imported netlist,
called <i>input netlist</i> needs to be saved in the board file.
<p>
<i>Back annotation</i> is when the user makes a deliberate edit in
pcb-rnd that contradicts with the <i>input netlist</i> (or at least not
mentioned in the input netlist), then pcb-rnd keeps track on this
deviation from the input netlist and later on the deviation is sent back
to the schematics editor where the schematics is upgraded to incorporate
the chnages made in pcb-rnd.
<p>
Just by looking at a conflicting edit, pcb-rnd can not decide if it was
accidental or delibrate. Therefore by default pcb-rnd assumes a
conflicting edit is a mistake. When the user wants make a deliberate deviation
from the input netlist, they need to indicate this by using a dedicated
commandfor making the change so pcb-rnd understands it's a change that needs
to be tracked and back annotated.
<p>
Tracking such changes intended for back annotation is done using the
<i>netlist patch<i>, which is also saved in the board file (when using the
right file format). The netlist patch is an ordered list of simple,
<a href="TODO">atomic operations</a> the user made to deliberately change
the "current state" of the project in pcb-rnd. This netlist patch is then
can be exported in pcb-rnd and imported in the schematics editor where
the schematics can be upgraded. Then upon the next forward annotation,
pcb-rnd automatically detects if changes on the board's netlist patch
are applied to the schematics and removes those changes from the
board's netlist patch.
<p>
Implementation detail: once a deliberate change is made for back
annotation, pcb-rnd assumes this is the new state of the project and
all checks are done accordingly. For example if the user uses back annotation
tools to remove the connection of U4-3 to gnd, what the next rats nest
generatio (hotkey: {c r}) does is making sure that all connections from
the input netlist are done properly, except for the "U4-3 to gnd" connection,
which is still part of the input netlist but not part of the "current state"
of the project. This is done by maintaining a second netlist in memory,
called the <i>edited netlist</i>; this one is never saved in a file. The edited
netlist is the input netlist plus netlist patches applied.
<p>
Schematics editor side support: in the simplest case the schematics
editor should load the back annotation patch file and present it as a
list of changes the user needs to perform.
A more advanced approach is also auto-detect whether the changes have been
done and present the state of each item of the list on the UI.
An even more advanced feature is when the schematics editor can
make edits, upon explicit request from the user, to implement items from
the list (sch-rnd can do this for most instructions).

<h3> Schematics editors and file formats and versions </h3>
<p>
At the time of writing (September 2023), the following back annotation
support is available.
<p>
Back annotation file formats that can be saved from pcb-rnd:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>format    <th> comments
<tr><td> bap
    <td> The old Back Annotation Patch format originally developed for
         pcb-rnd to gschem back annotation; limited to a few types of
         instructions: can do pin swaps, break conn and add conn; this
         file format is very simple but lacks header and version information
         so can not be extended/upgraded.

<tr><td> <a href="http://www.repo.hu/projects/tedax/backann.html">tEDAx backann v1</a>
    <td> Similar functionality as bap, but has a proper file format with
         header, well documented syntax (handling corner cases like escaping
         whitespace) and versioning so that it could be upgraded. Supports
         the same features as bap, plus subcircuit and network attribute
         changes.

<tr><td> <a href="http://www.repo.hu/projects/tedax/backann_v2.html">tEDAx backann v2</a>
    <td> Newer version of backann; also supports adding and removing
         subcircuits.

<tr><td> pcb
    <td> This is an internal format that should be used only by the code
         when saving the old .pcb format from the times when pcb-rnd still
         used gEDA/PCB's file format but already extended it (for example
         with netlist patches). Supported functionality matches bap, but
         nothing reads this format from a stand-alone file.
</table>

<p>
Schematic editors that can use pcb-rnd exported back annotations:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>software  <th> limitations
<tr><td>sch-rnd   <td> none - supports everything pcb-rnd does; supports auto-fix for most instructions
<tr><td>xschem    <td> works using the old bap format; later on may upgrade to tEDAx backann v2; no auto-fix
<tr><td>gschem    <td> from about 2019 (1.10.x), it supports bap; no auto-fix; no hope for an upgrade
</table>


<p>
Schematic editors vs. file format version vs. functionality:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th> software
    <th> bap
    <th> tEDAx backann v1
    <th> tEDAx backann v2
    <th> present list of changes
    <th> auto-detect if item is implemented
    <th> auto-fix item when requested

<!--     software       bap |  tdx v1 | tdx v2 | present | detect | fix -->
<tr><td> sch-rnd   <td> yes <td> yes <td> yes <td> yes  <td> yes <td> yes
<tr><td> gschem    <td> yes <td> no  <td> no  <td> yes  <td> yes <td> no
<tr><td> xschem    <td> yes <td> no  <td> no  <td> yes  <td> ?   <td> ?
