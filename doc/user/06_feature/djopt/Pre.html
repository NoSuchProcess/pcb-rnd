<H1> Action djopt() </h1>

The different types of optimizations change your board in order to
reduce the total trace length and via count. Each optimization is accessible
using an argument, e.g. djopt(miter). The basic actions have to be run multiple
times as each iteration will change the design making new changes possible for
subsequent iterations with the same or other actions.
