<h2 autotoc="yes"> Action djopt() </h1>

The different types of optimizations change your board in order to
reduce the total trace length and via count. Each optimization is accessible
using an argument, e.g. djopt(miter). The basic actions have to be run multiple
times as each iteration will change the design making new changes possible for
subsequent iterations with the same or other actions.

<tr><th>argument name<th> description <th> example in <th> example out after 1st iteration
<tr><th>debumpify<td>
Looks for U-shaped traces (with 90 degree corners) that can be shortened
or eliminated.
  <td><a href="debumpify.pcb"><img src="debumpify.png"></a>  <td><a href="debumpify.out.pcb"><img src="debumpify.out.png"></a>
<tr><th>miter<td>
Replaces 90 degree corners with a pair of 45 degree corners, to reduce
RF losses and trace length.
  <td><a href="miter.pcb"><img src="miter.png"></a>  <td><a href="miter.out.pcb"><img src="miter.out.png"></a>
<tr><th>orthopull<td>
Looks for chains of traces all going in one direction, with more
traces orthogonal on one side than on the other.  Moves the chain in
that direction, causing a net reduction in trace length, possibly
eliminating traces and/or corners.

<tr><th>unjaggy<td>
Looks for corners which could be flipped to eliminate one or more
corners (i.e. jaggy lines become simpler).
  <td><a href="unjaggy.pcb"><img src="unjaggy.png"></a>  <td><a href="unjaggy.out.pcb"><img src="unjaggy.out.png"></a>
<tr><th>vianudge<td>
Looks for vias where all traces leave in the same direction.  Tries to
move via in that direction to eliminate one of the traces (and thus a
corner).
  <td><a href="vianudge.pcb"><img src="vianudge.png"></a>  <td><a href="vianudge.out.pcb"><img src="vianudge.out.png"></a>
<tr><th>viatrim<td>
Looks for traces that go from via to via, where moving that trace to a
different layer eliminates one or both vias.
  <td><a href="viatrim.pcb"><img src="viatrim.png"></a>  <td><a href="viatrim.out.pcb"><img src="viatrim.out.png"></a>
