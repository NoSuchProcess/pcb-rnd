<p>
Determine length of a list.
<p>

Return value: integer length of the list.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> mklist(args...) </h3>
<p>
Determine length of a list.
<p>

<p>
Variable number of objects.
<p>
Return value: a list built of the objects passed.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) </h3>
<p>
Calculate the distance of two points.
<p>
Arguments:
<ul>
	<li> x1: first point, X coordinate
	<li> y1: first point, Y coordinate
	<li> x2: second point, X coordinate
	<li> y2: second point, Y coordinate
</ul>
<p>
Return value: floating point distance value in nanometers.


<h3 autotoc="yes"> violation(i1, v1, ..., iN, vN) </h3>
<p>
Build a DRC violation report.
<p>
Arguments (a variable number of pairs of instruction and value):
<ul>
	<li> i is an instruction, see below.
	<li> v is a value (a constant or an object)
</ul>
<p>
Instruction is one of the following constants:
<ul>
	<li> DRCGRP1 - the following v is an object, part of group 1 of offending objects
	<li> DRCGRP2 - the following v is an object, part of group 2 of offending objects
	<li> DRCEXPECT - the following v is a numeric value that represent the expected value
	<li> DRCMEASURE - the following v is a numeric value that represent the measured value that mismatches the expected value
</ul>
<p>
Return value: a list suitable for the drc_query to process.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> netlist() </h3>
<p>
Return the netlist.
<p>
Arguments: None.
<p>
Return value: an unordered list of all networks specified on the
<i>edited</i> netlist (which is the netlist the board is currently
using). Each item of the list is a net.


<h3 autotoc="yes"> netterms(net) </h3>
<p>
Return terminals of a network.
<p>
Arguments:
<ul>
	<li> net is a network of the netlist of the current board.
</ul>
<p>
Return value: an unordered list of objects (each terminal of the network
as described by the <i>edited</i> netlist).


<h3 autotoc="yes"> netobjs(net) </h3>
<p>
Return terminals and all copper objects galvanically connected to a network.
<p>
Arguments:
<ul>
	<li> net is a network of the netlist of the current board.
</ul>
<p>
Return value: an unordered list of copper objects connected to the network.


<h3 autotoc="yes"> netsegs(net) </h3>
<p>
Return a list of objects, one terminal object per disconnecte segment of
the network.
<p>
Arguments:
<ul>
	<li> net is a network of the netlist of the current board.
</ul>
<p>
Return value: an unordered list of terminal objects, one picked randomly
from each disconnected segment of the net.


<h3 autotoc="yes"> netbreak(obj, minimum_overlap) </h3>
<p>
Start a search on a galvanically connected network segment starting from
an object (typically returned by netsegs()) and generate a DRC violation
if there are copper objects with overlap smaller than the minimum_overlap.
<p>
Arguments:
<ul>
	<li> obj is the starting object of the search
	<li> minimum_overlap is the coordinate value that represents the minimum required ovlerap between copper objects (e.g. 0.5mm)
</ul>
<p>
Return value: a list that represents a DRC violation (or empty list).

<h3 autotoc="yes"> netshort(obj, minimum_distance) </h3>
<p>
Start a search on a galvanically connected network segment starting from
an object (typically returned by netsegs()) and generate a DRC violation
if there are disconnected copper objects with distance smaller than
the minimum_distance from the network.
<p>
Arguments:
<ul>
	<li> obj is the starting object of the search
	<li> minimum_distance is the coordinate value that represents the minimum required distance from any non-connected copper objects (e.g. 0.5mm)
</ul>
<p>
Return value: a list that represents a DRC violation (or empty list).

<h3 autotoc="yes"> subcobjs(subc) </h3>
<p>
Return a list of objects that are within the subc.
<p>
Arguments:
<ul>
	<li> subc is an object of type subcircuit
</ul>
<p>
Return value: an unordered list of objects.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> action(args...) </h3>
<p>
Execute a pcb-rnd action.
<p>
Arguments: variable nunmber of objects and constants.
<p>
Return value: invalid on error, or the return value of the action.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> getconf(path) </h3>
<p>
Fetch the value of a config node
<p>
Arguments:
<ul>
	<li> path is a conf node path, e.g. editor/grid
</ul>
<p>
Return value: invalid if the config node doesn't exist, else the value of
the config node (converted to the most appropriate data type).


<h3 autotoc="yes"> pstkring(pstk, minimum_ring_thickness) </h3>
<p>
Return the number of layers on which the ring of a padstack is too thin.

</ul>
<p>
Return value: 0 if the polygon has been cleared out of existnece, 1 for normal
polygons and a positive integer higher than 1 if the polygon has the FULLPOLY
flag and is sliced into multiple parts not naturally connected by the polygon
itself.


<h3 autotoc="yes"> overlap(obj1, obj2) </h3>
