<h3 autotoc="yes"> Advanced layer access </h3>

	<h4 autotoc="yes"> layer_setup(obj, directive [, res]) </h4>
	<p id="layer_setup">
	Takes an object and executes a directive on the layer setup of the object.
	If the directive matches, retruns either a measure (if result is specified)
	or returns true.
	<p>
	Directive is a comma separated list of requirements; the directive matches
	only if all requirements matched. A requirement is specified in the form
	of <i>key:value</i>.
	<p>
	<i>Key</i> is a dash separated list of:
	<ul>
		<li> <i>above</i> - match a layer group that is above the object's layer (location modifier)
		<li> <i>below</i> - match a layer group that is below the object's layer (location modifier)
		<li> <i>on</i> - match the layer group of the object (location modifier)
		<li> <i>type</i> - match a layer group type; <i>value</i> is a layer group type
		<li> <i>net</i> - objects belonging to a specific net on an adjacent copper layer group that covers the current object; <i>value</i> is the name of a net
		<li> <i>netmargin</i> - supplement for the <i>net</i> key: require the cover to extend the specified; <i>value</i> is a size (coord)
	</ul>
	<p>
	Examples requirements:
	<ul>
		<li> <i>above-type:copper</i> - there is an adjacent copper layer group above the object's layer
		<li> <i>below-type:!copper</i> - there is no adjacent copper layer group below the object's layer
		<li> <i>above-net:vcc</i> - there are copper objects connected to the net called "vcc" on the adjacent copper layer group above the current object
		<li> <i>above-net:vcc,above-netmargin:1.3mm</i> - there are copper objects connected to the net called "vcc" on the adjacent copper layer group above the current object; coverage calculated +1.3mm around the object; defaults to 0 if not specified
	</ul>
	<p>
	"Above" and "below" are not in the board's coordinate system, but are
	relative to the object. In other words, the function first assumes
	above is upward and below is downward, then runs all requirements on the object.
	If there is no match, above/below directions are reversed and the test is ran
	again.
	<p>
	Example directive:
	<p><i>above-type:!copper,below-net:gnd,below-netmargin:125mil</i>
	<p>This directive requires:
	<ul>
		<li> there's no copper layer group above the object (so that the object is on the top or bottom copper layer group)
		<li> the object is fully covered on the adjacent copper layer group "below" by copper objects belonging to the network named "gnd"
		<li> plus this coverage extends beyond the object to 125mil in every direction
	</ul>
	<p>
	Normally the return value is integer 0 (no match) or 1 (match).
	<p>
	If the optional <i>res</i> parameter is specified, it must be a requirement
	where key is <i>result</i>. Alternatively the <i>result</i> requirement can
	be specified in the <i>directive</i> parameter. When a <i>result</i> is
	specified, the return value of layer_setup() will not be a 0/1 boolean but
	a readout specified by the <i>result</i> requirement (or the <i>invalid value</i>
	is returned on no match). The value of a
	<i>result</i> requirement is one of:
	<ul>
		<li> <i>above</i> - use a layer group that is above the object's layer (location modifier)
		<li> <i>below</i> - use a layer group that is below the object's layer (location modifier)
		<li> <i>on</i> - use the layer group of the object (location modifier)
		<li> <i>substrate</i> - return the substrate layer group (using the location)
		<li> <i>uncovered</i> - return the area (in square nanometers) that are not covered by the "net" directive; note: the total area is the area of the original object bloated by netmargin
	</ul>
	<p>
	Complex query script example:
	<p>layer_setup(OBJ, "above-type:!copper,below-net:gnd", "result:below-substrate").a."thickness"
	<p>
	OBJ will match if it is on the top or bottom copper layer and is fully
	covered by gnd copper on the adjacent copper layer group on the next internal
	copper layer group. When matched, the return value of layer_setup is the
	substrate layer group between the object's layer and that adjacent
	internal layer group. The .a."thickness" part retrieves the value of
	the thickness attribute of this substrate layer. On mismatch, the whole expression
	evaluates to the <i>invalid value</i>.
