<H2 autotoc="yes"> Query: the query language </H2>

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Intro </h3>
<p>
A DRC program is an unordered list of rules. Rules are evaluated and
violations reported. The advantage of a declarative language is that
intermediate results can be cached and reused.
<p>
The language is intended to be human readable and human writable, but
the main goal is to let programs and scripts (e.g. netlisters) to
generate it.
<p>
A rule consists of three parts:
<ul>
	<li> the <i>rule</i> keyword; syntax: <b>rule NAME</b>, where NAME is an arbitrary string
	<li> build variables (lists) using search statements, using the <i>let</i> keyword
	<li> state assertions about those lists, using the <i>assert</i> keyword
	<li> comments, empty lines
</ul>
<p>
A simpler variant of a rule is a single expression, without any <i>rule</i> or
<i>let</i> or <i>assert</i> keywords in it.
<p>
Various parts of pcb-rnd, including the <i>advanced search feature</i> and
the <i>query()</i> action, runs a DRC rule (typically the simplified,
single-expression variant) to find/select/list drawing objects.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Variables (lists) </h3>
<p>
Variables are named by the user and are local to the rule. A variable
always holds a <i>list</i> of objects. Lists are ordered.
A list is consists of zero or more objects. An object is on of the following:
<ul>
	<li> the board
	<li> a layer
	<li> a drawing primitive (line, arc, polygon, padstack, text), whether it is part of a subcircuit or is directly on the board
	<li> a subcircuit
	<li> a net
</ul>

<p>
Objects have named properties (or fields):
<ul>
	<li> core attributes: for each object type a predefined set of key=value
	     pairs that always exist (e.g. thickness of a line, start angle of
	     an arc); these field names starts with "p."
	<li> user attributes: free-form key=value pairs optionally assigned by
	     the user; these field names start with "a."
</ul>

<p>
Note: the language is case sensitive with keywords and builtins using
lowercase only. For better readability, in syntax description in this
document uppercase words are user chosen identifiers or fields.  (This
does not mean identifiers have to be uppercase in a program.)
<p>
Whitespace character sequences are usually treated as a single whitespace.
<p>
The syntax of a search statement that stores a result in a list is:
<pre>
let LISTNAME EXPR
</pre>

<p>
It creates a list called LISTNAME and evaluates expression EXPR to all
available objects and adds the objects that match EXPR to the list. Each
matching object is added only once.
<p>
The particular order of objects on the list depends on how iterations are
taken in EXPR. For example if EXPR refers to only one list (e.g. @), the
ordering of that list is preserved in the result as well.
<p>
Object "matches EXPR" when the EXPR evaluated on the object yields true.

<p>
A special list that always exist is called @, and contains all subcircuits
and drawing objects present on the board (including those that are part of
subcircuits), in random order.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Expressions and values </h3>
<p>
An expression is evaluated to a value. A value can be:
<ul>
	<li>an object
	<li>a list
	<li>scalar: a number or string (might be suffixed, like "42 mm")
	<li>void (empty, nil, also known as false)
</ul>

<p>
A value is considered true if:
<ul>
	<li>it is an existing object; or
	<li>it is a non-empty list; or
	<li>it is a non-zero number or non-empty string
</ul>

<p>
An expression is one of:

<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>syntax                      <th>meaning
<tr><td>(EXPR)                      <td>change precedence
<tr><td>EXPR || EXPR                <td>logical OR (result: number)
<tr><td>EXPR &amp;&amp; EXPR        <td>logical AND (result: number)
<tr><td>EXPR1 thus EXPR2            <td>evaluate to EXPR2 if EXPR1 is true, else to void
<tr><td>EXPR + EXPR                 <td>add (numbers only)
<tr><td>EXPR - EXPR                 <td>subtract (numbers only)
<tr><td>EXPR * EXPR                 <td>multiply (numbers only)
<tr><td>EXPR / EXPR                 <td>divide (numbers only)
<tr><td>EXPR == EXPR                <td>the two values are equal (result: number)
<tr><td>EXPR != EXPR                <td>the two values are not equal (result: number)
<tr><td>EXPR ~ string               <td>regex match left EXPR using pattern right string (result: number)
<tr><td>EXPR &gt; EXPR              <td>left EXPR is greater than right EXPR (number only)
<tr><td>EXPR &gt;= EXPR             <td>left EXPR is greater than or equal to right EXPR (number only)
<tr><td>EXPR &lt; EXPR              <td>left EXPR is less than right EXPR (number only)
<tr><td>EXPR &lt;= EXPR             <td>left EXPR is less than or equal to right EXPR (number only)
<tr><td>!EXPR                       <td>logical NOT (result: number, 0 or 1)
<tr><td>FUNC(EXPR, EXPR, ...)       <td>call a function with 0 or more arguments
<tr><td>EXPR.field                  <td>evaluated to the value of an object field (see P45, P46)
</table>

<p>
The syntax of an assertion is:
<pre>
assert EXPR
</pre>

<p>
When running the DRC, if the EXPR in an assert evaluates to false, a
DRC violation is generated. The return value of such an expression should
normally be a list generated using the violation() function, so that it
can pass on all relevant details (such as expected value, affected objects)
to the DRC display.
<p>
When running a search, normally the result of an assert should be an object.

<p>
If an EXPR references a variable (list), it is evaluated for all
valid members of the list, in order of the list. For example
if there is a variable called FOO, which is a list of objects
(built using a search statement), expression
<pre>
FOO.p.thickness
</pre>
<p>
is evaluated as many times as many objects are on the list.
If there is another similar list called BAR, an expression:
<pre>
(FOO.p.thickness &lt; BAR.p.thickness)
</pre>
<p>
will compare each possible pair of FOO and BAR objects. That is, if
FOO has 4 objects and BAR has 15 objects, that is 4*15 = 60 comparisons.
<p>
However, each list is iterated only once, even if it is referenced multiple
times in the same expression. For example, with the above lists:
<pre>
(FOO.p.clearance &gt; 10 mil) &amp;&amp; (FOO.p.thickness &lt; BAR.p.thickness)
</pre>
the potential number of iterations is still 4*15, and not 4*4*15 (FOO is
not iterated twice). In practice the engine leverages lazy evaluation so
if FOO.p.clearance is smaller than 10 mil, the right side is not evaluated,
which saves a few comparisons. See also: <a href="#fields">fields</a>.
<p>
If a function needs to be called with a whole list passed instead of
calling to function for each element of the list, the special list()
built-in function should be used. For example assume FOO is a list of 5
objects:
<pre>
llen(list(FOO))
</pre>
<p>
will pass FOO as a list to function llen(), which is called only once. Without
the list() wrapping, llen() would be called five times, once for each item
in the list.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Fields (properties and atributes) </h3>
<p id="fields">
A field reference is valid if the field exists. For example a line object
has a thickness attribute, thus the .p.thickness is valid, but a polygon
object does not have a thickness and .p.thickness on a polygon is invalid.
An user attribute reference (e.g. field .a.baz) is valid if the attribute
key exists in the given object.
<p>
Invalid fields evaluate to value void (and is not considered an error).
Thus if variable BLOBB is a list
that consists of 3 line, 2 arc and a layer objects, the following expression
will be void (false) for at least the 3 line objects and can be true
for at most 2 cases (the arc objects):
<pre>
(BLOBB.p.width &gt;= 10 mm)
</pre>
(because only arc objects have valid .p.width field, which is the horizontal
radius of an arc).

<p>
A void value is never equal to anything. A void value is not equal
even to another void value.
