<p>
The query language is a powerful domain specific, declarative scripting
language that can:
<ul>
	<li> list drawing objects, layers and networks
	<li> iterate over them
	<li> evaluate complex logical expressions using them
	<li> selecting/unselecting/printing or drc-reporting objects depending on the result of the evaluation.
</ul>
<p>
This chapter describes the query language and its use. The chapter is
split up to multiple sub-chapters:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="functions.html"> query functions </a>
	<li> <a href="tutor_cli.html"> CLI/scripting tutorial </a>
</ul>
