<h2 id="" autotoc="yes"> The vendordrill plugin - Apply Vendor Drills and DRC </h2>
<p>
Load and Apply vendor file to the current design.

<h3 id="description" autotoc="yes"> Description </h3>
<p>
Footprint holes are predefined within each footprint and layer
characteristics are predefined in the layout file. Consequentially, hole
sizes may vary among footprints or not match a vendor's available drill
availability unless manually adjusted. Likewise, predefined layout layer
characteristics may mismatch a vendor's specific requirements. For
example one type of Through-Hole resistor footprint may have 40mil holes
while another may have 43.5 mil holes.

<p>
Some PCB fabricators have a finite set of drill sizes available. In this
case loading a vendor file will automatically adjust the layout's hole
sizes to agree with the vendor's drill availability.

<p>
Many current PCB fabricators offer any drill size within a tolerance with
just a minimum and maximum. In this case the layout's holes do not need
to match specific drill sizes but it may be desirable to normalize the
hole sizes. While the user may want all holes consistent for aesthetic
reasons there may be a fabrication cost saving if hole sizes are
consistent. Likewise, design rules, such as trace width and minimum
separation, can impact fabrication cost. In this situation the drills
listed in the vendor files would not be specific drill availability but
rather normalization values.

<p>
The LoadVendorFrom() Action enables a file of vendor specific fabrication
requirements to be loaded to the current design. When the vendor file is
applied, holes will be automatically adjusted to conform to the drill
sizes listed in the vendor file and layer characteristics will be used in
any subsequent Design Rule Checks (DRC).  Some critical parts where you
may not want to change the drill size can be identified to be left alone
- "skipped".

<h3 id="vendor-file-requirements" autotoc="yes"> Vendor File Requirements </h3>
<ul>

	<li> The vendor file is a text file in lihata format. It expects a
	     <strong>drillmap</strong> section and supports two other sections -
	     <strong>drc</strong> and <strong>skips</strong>. <strong>Skips</strong>
	     defines subcircuits to be <em> skipped </em>, hence the name. Skips'
	     <a href="http://www.repo.hu/projects/genregex/genregex.7.html">extended regex</a>
	     patterns may only be defined for "refdes", "value" and
	     "descr" attributes.

	<li> The file name can be any existing, readable filename. The file name
	     may be entered in two ways - explicitly or using the standard file load
	     dialog box of the currently active HID.
		<ul>
			<li> LoadVendorFile(your_vendor_filename)
			<li> LoadVendorFile()
		</ul>

	<li> Defaults if no entry provided
		<ul>
			<li> vendor file = <strong>vendor.lht</strong> (allowed entries:
			     any readable filename in lihata vendor file format)
			<li> units = <strong>mil</strong> (allowed entries: mil|mils|inch|inches|mm)
			<li> round = <strong>up</strong> (allowed entries up|nearest)
		</ul>
	</ul>
