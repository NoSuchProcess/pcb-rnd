<h2> smartdisperse - smart netlist disperse</h2>
<p>
The smartdisperse plugin provides an action called <i>smartdisperse</i> that
uses a loaded netlist to arranges layout subcircuits linear order based on
refdes.
<p>
The plugin is useful with a GUI HID for initial layout, as well as with batch
mode to programmatically generate subcircuit 'proof' sheets. The layout must
include a netlist for smartdisperse to work.  The plugin uses the netlist to
disperse all the subcircuits or all selected subcircuits according to a linear
order in a spaced grid at the top of the board outline.
<h3> Intended use: aide with intial layout</h3>
