<h2> smartdisperse - smart netlist disperse</h2>
<p>
The smartdisperse plugin provides an action called <i>smartdisperse</i> that
uses a loaded netlist to arrange the layout subcircuits in a linear order at
the top of the board, based on the netlist connections rather than arbitrary
subcircuit order. To use, run in the cli with :smartdisperse() or
:smartdisperse(all) to disperse all subcircuits, or :smartdisperse(selected) to
only disperse selected.
<p>
The plugin is intended for use with any GUI HID for board layout. The layout
must include a netlist for smartdisperse to work. The plugin uses the netlist
to prioritize the dispersal of all the subcircuits into clusters prioritized by
netlist connections.
