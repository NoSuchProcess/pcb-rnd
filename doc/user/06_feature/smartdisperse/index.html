<h2> smartdisperse - smart netlist disperse</h2>
<p>
The smartdisperse plugin provides an action called <i>smartdisperse</i> that
uses a loaded netlist to arrange the layout subcircuits in a linear order based.
on the netlist connections rather than arbitrary subcircuit order.
<p>
The plugin is useful with a GUI HID for initial layout, as well as with batch
mode to programmatically generate subcircuit 'proof' sheets. The layout must
include a netlist for smartdisperse to work. The plugin uses the netlist to
disperse all the subcircuits into clusters prioritized by netlist connections.
