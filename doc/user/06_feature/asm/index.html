<h2 autotoc="yes"> asm - manual assembly helper </h2>
<p>
The asm plugin provides an action called <i>asm</i> which pops up a dialog
box that assists manual assembly of the current board. The plugin is useful only
with a GUI HID.
<p>
The plugin lists, groups and sorts all subcircuits (parts) that are placed
on the current board. The asm dialog presents all subcircuits in a tree of two
levels. the first level is all part groups. In each part group, the second level
is all parts that have the same grouping template. The list of groups is
sorted by group properties and the lists of parts within each groups are
sorted by the sorting template. While the assembly dialog is open, clicking a
part or a group of parts will highlight (select) the parts in the main window.

<h3> Intended use: rapid full board building </h3>
<p>
The intended use is configuring the plugin to group parts by assembly steps.
Each group should contain parts that are "coming from the same bin". Within
each group parts should be sorted by board side and location. 
<p>
The user should click the first part in the first group, check the highlight,
solder on the part and click the 'part done' button. This will skip to the
next part, while the focus stays on the same button. From now on, simply
pressing enter indicates the currently highlighted part is done, soldered
on the board.
<p>
In this setup the grouping template should contain a height hint attribute
of the subcircuits so that taller parts are built last.

<h3> Intended use: build by functionality </h3>
<p>
It is also possible to configure the grouping/sorting templates to support
a per functionality build, which is more useful in building and testing the
first prototype.
<p>
In this scenario subcircuits shall have a dedicated attribute defining
which functionality each part belongs to - preferably this attribute
should be coming from the schematics. The group template shall contain this
attribute as the first field, so groups are created and sorted by functionality.

<h3> Templates </h3>
<p>
There are two configured templates under /plugins/asm1:
<ul>
	<li> group_template: for rendering the <i>group string</i> for each part
	<li> sort_template: for rendering the <i>sort string</i> for each part
</ul>
<p>
The <i>group string</i> is used for grouping parts and as the sorting function
for the groups. If two parts have the same group string, they will end up
in the same group. The <i>sort string</i> is used for sorting parts within
their group.
<p>
A template is comma separated list of directives. A directive is one of
the following:
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>directive   <th>substituted with...
<tr><td>side        <td>either "0/top" or "1/bottom" depending on which side the subcircuit is placed on
<tr><td>x           <td>subcircuit origin X coordinate in mm, without unit
<tr><td>y           <td>subcircuit origin X coordinate in mm, without unit
<tr><td>a.<i>key</i><td>with the value of the subcircuit's attribute with matching <i>key</i>
</table>
<p>
For example the group template
<pre>
a.footprint, a.value, a.asm::group
</pre>
<p>
will be executed by pasting the footprint attribute, a comma, the value
attribute, a comma and the asm::group attribute. This will typically result
in something like "1206,100nF,". The resulting group string is then used for
grouping and sorting the groups alphabetically.
