<h2> ddraft - 2 dimensional drafting aid </h2>
<p>
The purpose of ddraft is to provide actions and GUI tools to help users
drawing precise 2d drafts. Many of the features in ddraft are very similar
to those found in standard 2d CAD packages.
<p>
Ddraft uses the following coordinate system (when looked from the top
of the board):
<p>

<h3> constraints </h3>
<p>
Coordinate and/or angle constraints can be applied on line drawing (when
<i>all-direction lines</i> turned on) and move operation. Executing the
<i>constraint()</i> action without arguments opens a dialog box with the
settings. The same settings are accessible from the command line, using
the <i>constraint()</i> action with arguments:
<p>
<table border=1>
	<caption><b>Constraint arguments: explicitly set</b>
	<tr><th> action syntax                            <th> description
	<tr><td> constraint(line_angle, ang1, ang2, ...)  <td> permit drawing lines only at specific angles
	<tr><td> constraint(line_angle_mod, ang)          <td> permit drawing lines only at angles which are integer multiplies of <i>ang</i>
	<tr><td> constraint(line_length, len1, len2, ...) <td> draw lines with length matching any length on the list
	<tr><td> constraint(line_length_mod, len)         <td> draw lines with length matching any integer multiply of the <i>len</i>
	<tr><td> constraint(move_angle, ang1, ang2, ...)  <td> permit moving objects only at specific angles
	<tr><td> constraint(move_angle_mod, ang)          <td> permit moving objects only at angles which are integer multiplies of <i>ang</i>
	<tr><td> constraint(move_length, len1, len2, ...) <td> move objects at a distance matching any length on the list
	<tr><td> constraint(move_length_mod, len)         <td> move objects at a distance matching an integer multiply of the <i>len</i>
	<tr><td> constraint(reset)                        <td> reset all constraints
</table>
<p>
Length can include unit (on the GUI: without space). Multiple constraints
can be set in the same time. Constraints are reset upon explicit user
request or pcb-rnd restart.
<p>
For line drawing, it is possible to get the angle constraints calculated using
the line start point and an existing object:
<p>
<table border=1>
	<caption><b>Constraint arguments: calculated</b>
	<tr><th> action syntax   <th> description
	<tr><td> perp()          <td> click on a line; set line_angle perpendicular to that line
	<tr><td> paral()         <td> click on a line; set line_angle parallel to that line
	<tr><td> tang()          <td> click on an arc; set line_angle tangential to the circle of the arc
</table>

<h3> Cutting edges </h3>
<p>
For already existing, intersecting objects (lines and arcs), the user may
define cutting edges that can manipulate target objects they intersect. There
are two actions for cutting edges: trim() and split(). The first argument of
these actions is:
<ul>
	<li> object (selecting a single cutting edge)
	<li> selected (to use any selected object as cutting edge)
	<li> found (to use any found (green highlight) object as cutting edge)
</ul>
<p>
The objects participating may be on different layers. All calculation use
the centerline of the objects.
<p>
In a <b>trim</b> operation the target objects are cut at the intersection point,
excess parts (at the click) removed. If there are multiple cutting edges,
the shortest possible section is removed. The below examples are generated
with <i>trim(selected)</i>, clicking on the horizontal line at the small
triangle mark.
<p>
<img src="trim.png" alt="[Effect of trim on a few examples]">
<p>
In a <b>split</b> operation target objects are split into multiple section wherever
they cross a cutting edge. A split means a single line object becomes multiple
line objects or a single arc object becomes multiple arc objects.

<h3> Command line drafting </h3>
<p>
The above features are pcb-rnd actions designed to fit in the action framework,
to work together with the original pcb-rnd drawing tools, like the line tool.
An alternative to that is using the new, ddraft command line interpreter, which
offers a different syntax, optimized for drafting.
<p>
There are two ways to use the ddraft command line interpreter:
<ul>
	<li> a command wrapped in the ddraft() action, e.g. <i>ddraft(line from 1,3 to 4,2)</i>
	<li> switching the command entry to <i>ddraft CLI mode</i>, by issuing the <i>ddraft()</i> action;
	     to exit from the ddraft CLI mode, type /exit
</ul>
<p>
When used as a CLI mode, mouse clicks on the drawing will also edit the
command line at the cursor. The generic rule is that a click will replace
an already entered numerical value or inserts a missing numerical value, but
all instruction keywords are typed on the keyboard. Instructions can
be abbreviated; the shortest form accepted is the shortest prefix that
is unique among the instruction keywords. For example "li" means "line"
and "rel" or even "re" works for "relative".
<p>
The first instruction is the drawing command, which is one of the following.
<p>
<table border=1>
	<caption><b>ddraft drawing commands</b>
	<tr><th> command <th> syntax summary <th> purpose
	<tr><td> line
	    <td> line [from] <i>coord</i> to <i>coord</i> <!--[to <i>coord</i> ...]-->
	    <td> draw line segments on the current layer, using the current routing style
</table>
<p>
Parts enclosed in [] are optional. A <i>coord</i> description is a sequence
of absolute and relative coordinates:
<p>
<table border=1>
	<caption><b>ddraft drawing commands</b>
	<tr><th> keyword <th> next instruction (argument) <th> example <th> purpose
	<tr><td> absolute
	    <td rowspan=3> xcoord,ycoord
	    <td> abs 1mm,15mm
	    <td rowspan=3> an absolute coordinate; units are optional; must not contain space
	<tr><td> *
	    <td> *1mm,15mm
	<tr><td> &nbsp;
	    <td> 1mm,15mm

	<tr><td> relative
	    <td rowspan=2> xcoord,ycoord
	    <td> rel 1mm,15mm
	    <td rowspan=2> a relative coordinate measured from the absolute coord specified so far; units are optional; must not contain space
	<tr><td> @
	    <td> @1mm,15mm

	<tr><td> angle
	    <td rowspan=2> degree
	    <td> ang 15
	    <td rowspan=2> an absolute angle in degrees; always measured from the X axis; should be used together with <i>length</i>
	<tr><td> &lt;
	    <td> &lt;15

	<tr><td> relative angle
	    <td rowspan=2> degree
	    <td> rel ang 15
	    <td rowspan=2> a relative angle in degrees; always measured from the X axis; should be used together with <i>length</i>
	<tr><td> @&lt;
	    <td> @&lt;15

<!--TODO: paral -->

	<tr><td> length
	    <td rowspan=2> coord
	    <td> len 3.1mm
	    <td rowspan=2> length or distance to move from the previous coordinate; always relative; used together with an angle
	<tr><td> ~
	    <td> ~3.1mm

</table>
<p>
For example the sequence
<i>5mm,100mil relative 1mm,1mm relative angle 30 length 2mm</i>
means:
<ul>
	<li> step 1: start from absolute coords at 5mm, 100mil; after this the current coordinate is: 5.0000mm,2.5400mm
	<li> step 2: move relative (to the right and down) 1 and 1 mm; after this the current coordinate is: 6.0000mm,3.5400mm
	<li> step 3: the last move was a 45 degree move; relative to this 45 degrees, start moving at 30 degrees (that is, in absolute 75 degrees), and...
	<li> step 4: ... move 2mm in that direction
	<li> step 5: the sequence ends here, the coordinate it points to is: 6.5176mm,5.4719mm
</ul>
<p>
Below the same steps are demonstrated; dark red lines demonstrate the moves,
thin black lines show how they are calculated. The result is a single coordinate
marked with a thin black cross at step 5. The sequence itself does not draw
anything, the drawing merely demonstrates how the steps are executed in
memory.
<p>

<p>
Equivalent alternative forms for the same sequence:
<pre>
5mm,100mil rel 1mm,1mm rel ang 30 len 2mm
5mm,100mil @1mm,1mm @&lt;30~2mm
5,100mil @1,1 @&lt;30~2
</pre>
<p>
The last one assumes unit is set to mm.
