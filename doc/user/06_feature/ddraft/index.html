<h2> ddraft - 2 dimensional drafting aid </h2>
<p>
The purpose of ddraft is to provide actions and GUI tools to help users
drawing precise 2d drafts. Many of the features in ddraft are very similar
to those found in standard 2d CAD packages.
<p>
Ddraft uses the following coordinate system (when looked from the top
of the board):

<h3> constraints </h3>
<p>
Coordinate and/or angle constraints can be applied on line drawing (when
<i>all-direction lines</i> turned on) and move operation. Executing the
<i>constraint()</i> action without arguments opens a dialog box with the
settings. The same settings are accessible from the command line, using
the <i>constraint()</i> action with arguments:
<p>
<table border=1>
	<caption><b>Constraint arguments: explicitly set</b>
	<tr><th> action syntax                            <th> description
	<tr><td> constraint(line_angle, ang1, ang2, ...)  <td> permit drawing lines only at specific angles
	<tr><td> constraint(line_angle_mod, ang)          <td> permit drawing lines only at angles which are integer multiplies of <i>ang</i>
	<tr><td> constraint(line_length, len1, len2, ...) <td> draw lines with length matching any length on the list
	<tr><td> constraint(line_length_mod, len)         <td> draw lines with length matching any integer multiply of the <i>len</i>
	<tr><td> constraint(move_angle, ang1, ang2, ...)  <td> permit moving objects only at specific angles
	<tr><td> constraint(move_angle_mod, ang)          <td> permit moving objects only at angles which are integer multiplies of <i>ang</i>
	<tr><td> constraint(move_length, len1, len2, ...) <td> move objects at a distance matching any length on the list
	<tr><td> constraint(move_length_mod, len)         <td> move objects at a distance matching an integer multiply of the <i>len</i>
	<tr><td> constraint(reset)                        <td> reset all constraints
</table>
<p>
Length can include unit (on the GUI: without space). Multiple constraints
can be set in the same time. Constraints are reset upon explicit user
request or pcb-rnd restart.
<p>
For line drawing, it is possible to get the angle constraints calculated using
the line start point and an existing object:
<p>
<table border=1>
	<caption><b>Constraint arguments: calculated</b>
	<tr><th> action syntax   <th> description
	<tr><td> perp()          <td> click on a line; set line_angle perpendicular to that line
	<tr><td> paral()         <td> click on a line; set line_angle parallel to that line
	<tr><td> tang()          <td> click on an arc; set line_angle tangential to the circle of the arc
</table>

<h3> Cutting edges </h3>
<p>
For already existing, intersecting objects (lines and arcs), the user may
define cutting edges that can manipulate target objects they intersect. There
are two actions for cutting edges: trim() and split(). The first argument of
these actions is:
<ul>
	<li> object (selecting a single cutting edge)
	<li> selected (to use any selected object as cutting edge)
	<li> found (to use any found (green highlight) object as cutting edge)
</ul>
<p>
The objects participating may be on different layers. All calculation use
the centerline of the objects.
<p>
In a <b>trim</b> operation the target objects are cut at the intersection point,
excess parts (at the click) removed. If there are multiple cutting edges,
the shortest possible section is removed. The below examples are generated
with <i>trim(selected)</i>, clicking on the horizontal line at the small
triangle mark.
<p>

<p>
In a <b>split</b> operation target objects are split into multiple section wherever
they cross a cutting edge. A split means a single line object becomes multiple
line objects or a single arc object becomes multiple arc objects.
