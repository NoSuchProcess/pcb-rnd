<h2 autotoc="yes"> drc_query: query() based, scriptable Design Rule Checker </h2>
<p>
The drc_query plugin is a glue layer between the
<a href="../query">query plugin</a> and the DRC infrastructure. It allows the
user (and sch import flows) to script DRC checks and use these script as part
of the normal DRC workflow. This chapter describes the
<a href="#config">how to configure and use query()</a> based DRC scripts
and offers a <a href="#tutor">tutorial on developing DRC scripts</a>.

<h3 id="config" autotoc="yes">Configuration</h3>
<p>
DRC rules are specified as a list of hash nodes under the plugins/drc_query/rules
config path, from the config source of the user's choice. Commonly used config
sources:
<ul>
	<li> internal or system config: generic DRC rules
	<li> user config: generic, user maintained rules (extra default checks)
	<li> board file: board-specific rules, e.g. imported from the schematics
</ul>
<p>
Example 1: a full example of an user config, saved as ~/.pcb-rnd/drc_query.conf:
<pre>
li:pcb-rnd-conf-v1 {
  ha:overwrite {
    ha:plugins {
      ha:drc_query {
        li:definitions {
          ha:min_drill {
            type = coord
            desc = {minimum drill diameter}
            default = 0
          }
        }
        li:rules {
          ha:hole_dia {
            type = single hole
            title = hole too small
            desc = padstack hole diameter is too small
            disable = 0
            query = {(@.hole &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (@.hole &lt; $min_drill)}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
There are two main subtrees below ha:drc_query: definitions and rules.
<h4 autotoc="yes"> Definitions </h4>
<p>
Definitions create new config nodes under design/drc. These config nodes
can be used to configure parameters of the drc check. The order of
definitions does not matter but the name of each definition must be unique.
<p>
A definition is a named hash subtree with the following fields:
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>name    <th> mandatory <th> meaning
<tr><td>type    <td> yes       <td> data type of the configuration; one of: coord, boolean, integer, real, unit, color
<tr><td>desc    <td> no        <td> human readable description
<tr><td>default <td> no        <td> low priority default value (format depends on <i>type</i>) for the case the configuration node is not set
<tr><td>legacy  <td> no        <td> reserved for stock rules for compatibility with the old DRC, do not use in new rules
</table>
<p>
The definition in the above example creates config node <i>design/drc/min_drill</i>.
This new config node is accessible through the config system normally, through
the conf() action or the GUI (preferences dialog). From query(), it can
be referenced using the shorthand <i>$min_dirll</i> form.


<h4 autotoc="yes"> Rules </h4>
<p>
Text fields type, tilte and desc are optional user readable strings
that will be presented in the DRC report. The type::title pair serves
as an unique identifier for the rule. If optional disable is 'yes' or
'true' or a non-zero integer value, the rule is temporarily disabled.
<p>
Note: since drc errors are presented on a per type basis, and drc rules
are executed each in its own, independent context, the order of the hash
nodes within the <i>rules</i> list (merged from different config sources)
determines the order in which tests are performed, but otherwise does not
matter (as tests are independent).
<p>
Rules optionally can have a <i>source</i> field, which is a one word free form text,
indicating where the rule is coming from. User specified/configured rules
should leave this field empty. Rules imported from the netlist (or schematics)
should set this field to <i>netlist</i>. When present, the GUI will display rules from
the same source groupped. But the real purpose of the source field is to make
re-import of rules possible: when a new import from the same source is performed,
the import code should remove all rules coming from the source and create
new rules with the same source.
<p>
Query text may consists of multiple lines. The format is as described
<a href="../query">at the query plugin</a>. There are two alternate forms:
<ul>
	<li> a single expression (like in the example above); if the expression is
	     true, the last evaluated object (typically @) is marked as the DRC error
	<li> one or more <b>rule</b> constructs, each containing <b>let</b> and <b>assert</b>
	     statements; when an assert is true, the object(s) in the return value or
	     if that is not available, the last evaluated object is marked as the
	     DRC error.
</ul>
<p>
Example 2: a <b>rule</b> based query script example is finding overlapping drilled holes:
<pre>
query = {
  rule overlap
  let A @.type==PSTK
  let B A
  assert (A.ID &gt; B.ID) &amp;&amp; (distance(A.x, A.y, B.x, B.y) &lt; (A.hole + B.hole)/2) thus violation(DRCGRP1, A, DRCGRP2, B)
}
</pre>
<p>
Note: since drc errors are presented on a per type basis, and drc rules
are executed each in its own, independent context, the order of rules does not
matter.

<h3 id="tutor" autotoc="yes">Tutorial</h3>

<h4 autotoc="yes"> Single expression scripts </h4>
<p>
In Example 1, a single query() expression is used: it iterates through all
objects available (@) and evaluates whether the object's hole property is
smaller than a predefined value. This expression can result in three
different outcome for any object:
<ul>
	<li> invalid: e.g. when the object has no hole property because it is not
	     a padstack (this happens to all lines for example); in this case, no DRC
	     violation is reported
	<li> valid, false: no DRC violation is reported
	<li> valid, true: a DRC violation is reported
</ul>
<p>
Such simple, single-expression DRC rules are common for checks that need
to decide whether every single object matching some criteria passes a test
on its properties. It works for Example 1 because each padstack object
can be checked separately from any other object and the outcome of
a check depends only on properties of the single padstack object and constants.
There is only one iterator used, @, which iterates on all objects of the board.
<p>
Note: the left-side check of &amp;&amp; for hole diameter greater than zero
is needed because of the pcb-rnd data model: hole diameter zero means no hole
(e.g. smd pads) - no warning should be issued for that.

<h4 autotoc="yes"> Rule scripts </h4>
<p>
However, in some situations a DRC violation depends on two or more objects,
thus iterations need to be done on pairs (or tuplets) of objects. It is
done by:
<ul>
	<li> announcing a multi-statement <b>rule</b>
	<li> creating named lists of selected objects using the <b>let</b> statement
	<li> writing one or more <b>assert</b> statements with expression using @ and/or the lists
</ul>
<p>
Example 2 demonstrates a simple case of pair-wise iteration: first a list called
<i>A</i> is set up; it will contain all objects of the board whose type is PSTK.
Then list <i>A</i> is copied to <i>B</i> in the second <b>let</b>.
<p>
Note: the second argument of a <b>let</b> is always an expression. In
the first case it is more trivial: (@.type==PSTK). When this expression is
true, the last evaluated object (the current iteration with @) is appended
to the destination list (specified in the first argument). The second
<b>let</b> "copies" the list by expression (A). It really means:
having the iterator run on each item of <i>A</i>, evaluating each; they
will all be true (since they are existing objects); once an item is true,
the last evaluated object (the same that caused the expression to be true)
is appended to the left side-list <i>B</i>. The part that may be confusing
is this: on the left side, there's a <b>list name</b>, on the right side
there is an <b>expression</b>. Referencing a list within an expression
will always result in iteration and is always substituted by a single item
of the list.
<p>
Once the lists are set up, an <b>assert</b> is specified with an expression
that uses both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. This makes the query engine iterate
in nested loops for items of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, which means the expression
is evaluated to every possible pair of items in list <i>A</i> and list <i>B</i>.
<p>
Or in other words, any possible pair of padstacks on the board - including
the case of a virtual pair of the same padstack twice (since every padstack
is present on both lists). For example if the board has three padstacks
p1, p2 and p3, then <i>A</i> is [p1, p2, p3] and <i>B</i> is [p1, p2, p3]
too. The first iteration will take the first item of <i>A</i> and the
first item of <i>B</i>, so the pairing is p1 vs. p1. Avoiding such
false checks is easy by starting the <b>assert</b> expession by (A != B),
which will make the whole expression false for the virtual pair case.
<p>
Note: query has lazy evaluation so when the left side of an &amp;&amp; if
false, the right side is not evaluated. This it makes execution more
efficient to add such simple checks that limit the number of objects or
combinations to deal with as early as possible in the expression.
<p>
With that, we would be checking the same pairs twice still: p1 vs. p2
and then p2 vs. p1. The easiest way to avoid that is to consider
that each object has an unique integer ID that can be compared, which
allows us to write (A.ID > B.ID) instead od (A != B). This ensures
only 'ordered pairs' are considered, at about the same low cost of
check.
<p>
The left side of the &amp;&amp; filters duplicates and self-overlaps. The
right side is the actual check: it calculates the distance of the hole
centers using the distance() builtin function and compares the result
to the expected minimum distance which is the sum of the radii of the two
holes. Since a hole is always at the origin of the padstack, the hole's
center coordinate matches the padstack's coordinate. When A.x is written
in the expression, that really means: "take the object from list <i>A</i>
for the current iteration and extract its <i>x</i> property", which for
a padstack means the x coordinate of the padstack placement.
<p>
When both the left side and the right side of the &amp;&amp; evaluates to
true, that means the pair is valid and unique and the holes overlap. At
this point drc_query could already indicate the DRC violation, but it would
use the last evaulated object for indicating the location. Which means
the indication would mark only one of the two padstacks participating in the
overlap.
<p>
The <b>thus</b> keyword changes this: when the left side of <b>thus</b>
evaluates to true, instead of returning true, the right side is evaluated
and returned. The right side is a function call to the builtin function
<b>violation</b>, which will create a new list of instruction-objects pairs,
inserting the current iteration object from list <i>A</i> as group-1 object
and list <i>B</i> as group-2 object. In other words, it's
a list of the two padstack objects participating in the overlap, sorted into
two groups (red and blue on screen).
<p>
Call arguments for violation() are always pairs of a DRC* constant and an
object or numeric value. There can be 1 or more pairs.
The following DRC* constants can be used:
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th> name                    <th> meaning
<tr><td> DRCGRP1        <td> following object is in group-1 of offending objects
<tr><td> DRCGRP2        <td> following object is in group-2 of offending objects
<tr><td> DRCEXPECT      <td> following numeric constant is DRC-expected value (e.g. minimum or maximum)
<tr><td> DRCMEASURE     <td> following numeric constant is the measured value (that contradicts the expected value)
<tr><td> DRCTEXT        <td> following string or value is appended to the violation description as plain text
</table>
<p>
Using any of the above instructions is optional, with the following considerations:
<ul>
	<li> if a DRC rule is related to any drawing object, at least one
	     object should be listed as DRCGRP1 so that the user can identify
	     the location of the problem
	<li> if DRCMEASURE is specified, DRCEXPECT must also be specified, else
	     DRCMEASURE is ignored
	<li> order of instructions does not matter, except for: when multiple
	     DRCTEXT items are specified, their order is preserved
</ul>
