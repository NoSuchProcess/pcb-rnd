<h2 autotoc="yes"> CAM support </h2>
<p>
The purpose of the CAM support is to provide a unified interface to export a
board in different file formats using different exporter plugins. The
interface consists of a CLI layer (each export plugin's "cam" option) and
an optional GUI (the CAM plugin).

<h3 autotoc="yes"> CAM export support in multi-layer plugins with '-x plugin --cam' </h3>
<p>
This section is about the syntax used by the exporters that export
multiple layers (e.g. gerber, ps, png).
<p id="cli">
Each CAM-plugin-compatible exporter plugin offers an option called "cam".
The syntax and capabilities are the same for all exporter's cam option.
<p>
The syntax is:
<pre>
outfile=[global-opts] layergrp,layergrp,...
</pre>
<p>
where:
<ul>
	<li> outfile is the output file name template that substitutes %%:
		<ul>
			<li> %name% is substituted with the layer group name
			<li> %base% is substituted with the base name of the output file path (the file name without directories)
			<li> %top_offs% is substituted with the layer group offset from the top (top layer group being 0); only layer groups with the same material considered
			<li> %bot_offs% is substituted with the layer group offset from the bottom (bottom layer group being 0); only layer groups with the same material considered
		</ul>
	<li> optionally [global-opts]: a comma separated list of group-global (but per-output-file) options in [] brackets. Options supported:
		<ul>
			<li> okempty-group: warning suppression: do not warn when none of the layer groups referenced for an outfile exists (outfile can not be created or will be empty)
			<li> okempty-content: warning suppression: do not warn when all layer groups for an outfile were empty (outfile is normally created and valid, but is empty as no object got exported)
			<li> okempty: shorthand that enables both okempty-group and okempty-content
		</ul>
	<li> layergrp: one or more layer group addresses separated by comma (syntax is documented in <a href="../../09_appendix/layer_addr.html">layer addressing appendix.</a>)
</ul>
<p>
Examples:
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr> <th> directive
	     <th> explanation
	<tr> <td> bot.gbr=@bottom_copper,@bottom_silk
	     <td> export layer groups called bottom_copper and bottom_silk (by group name)
	<tr> <td> asm_top.ps=top-virtual(purpose=assy)
	     <td> export the top assembly layer group (by type)
	<tr> <td> fabrication.ps=virtual(purpose=fab)
	     <td> export the first virtual layer group with 'fab' purpose
	<tr> <td> gnd=copper:2
	     <td> export the second copper layer group from the top (the first internal copper layer group under the top copper layer group, if it is a multilayer board; for 2 layer boards this will be the bottom copper layer group)
	<tr> <td> gnd=intern-copper:1
	     <td> similar to the above, but addresses the first internal copper layer group explicitly so it can not end up being the bottom copper layer group
	<tr> <td> pwr=copper:-2
	     <td> export the second copper layer group from the bottom (the first internal copper layer group above the bottom copper layer group, if it is a multilayer board; for 2 layer boards this will be the top copper layer group)
	<tr> <td> gnd=intern-copper:-1
	     <td> similar to the above, but addresses the last internal copper layer group explicitly so it can not end up being the top copper layer group
	<tr> <td> pst.gbr=top-paste(bloat=0.1mm),bottom-paste(bloat=0.1mm)
	     <td> export the top and bottom paste groups in the same file with all objects bloated up by 0.1mm
	<tr> <td> plated_drills.cnc=virtual(purpose=pdrill)
	     <td> export plated drilled holes (padstack side effects, but no slots)
	<tr> <td> unplated_drills.cnc=virtual(purpose=udrill)
	     <td> export unplated drilled holes (padstack side effects, but no slots)
	<tr> <td> unplated_drills.cnc=[okempty] virtual(purpose=udrill)
	     <td> same as the previous, but do not print a warning if there was no unplated drill in the design
</table>
<p>
If multiple layer groups match a layergrp specification, all matching
layer groups are exported. If the file name is a static string, they are
all merged. If the file name is templated, it is possible to export the
layer groups in multiple files. For example:
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr> <th> directive
	     <th> explanation
	<tr> <td> copper.gbr=copper
	     <td> export all copper layers to copper.gbr
	<tr> <td> copper-%top_offs%.gbr=copper
	     <td> export all copper layers to numbered copper-<i>N</i>.gbr files where <i>N</i> is the offset from the top side, starting from 0 (for top copper)
	<tr> <td> copper-%name%.gbr=copper
	     <td> export all copper layers to numbered copper-<i>N</i>.gbr files where <i>N</i> is the full name of the group being exported
</table>

<h3 id="nolayer" autotoc="yes"> CAM export support in no-layer plugins with '-x plugin --cam' </h3>
<p>
This section is about the syntax used by the exporters export global digest
of the board and not layers (e.g. XY).
<p>
For these exporters the above apply with no layergrp specified. In the simplest
for this means the '=' and the rest of the line is omitted. However, if
supplement needs to be passed, the syntax is filename=(supplement).
For example the XY exporter can be used with
<pre>
--cam foo.xy
</pre>
or a <a href="#partial">partial</a> excellon export can be done using:
<pre>
--cam foo.exc=(partial)
</pre>
<p>
The --cam option in these exporters are implemented for two reasons:
<ul>
	<li> to provide an unified syntax for the output file name
	<li> to allow a CAM job to use these exporters
</ul>

<h3 id="partial" autotoc="yes"> partial export </h3>
<p>
In partial exporting the rendering code in core will draw only those object
that have the EXPORTSEL flag set. The flag is normally set by a query() action
using an expression.
<p>
A typical use of this feature is to export plugged/filled vias into a
separate file, assuming the padstacks have a specific attribute set.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> CAM plugin (CAM jobs) with '-x cam' </h3>
<p>
The CAM plugin is a way to manage output "jobs": collections of cam export
settings for reproducing export packages in various formats. 
<p>
...
<p>
A job is a script that contains zero or more export directives, separated
by semicolons or newlines. An export directive is one of these:
<pre>
desc text
plugin name [--option value] [--option value] ...
write outfile=layergrp[,layergrp,...]
</pre>
<p>
desc is a free form one-liner that describes what the job is for. Multiple
desc directives may be present (to bypass the limitation that the text can
not contain newlines).
<p>
The plugin directive selects a plugin and sets plugin specific options.
The plugin and options are active until the next plugin directive or the
end of the script. The first outfile directive must be preceeded by a
plugin directive.
<p>
The write directive argument has the same syntax as the cam argument for each
cam-capable exporter, <a href="#cli">see above</a>. Each write is a call
to an exporter the same way as if pcb-rnd was called with --cam and -x
with the exporter and options taken from the last plugin directive.
<p>
For example, the following config tree defines a job called <i>doc_png</i>
that generates two 600 DPI images from the sides of the board, copper and
silk combined, all in the doc/ dir (that is created if necessary):
<pre>
li:pcb-rnd-conf-v1 {
	ha:overwrite {
		ha:plugins {
			ha:cam {
				li:jobs {
					doc_png {
						desc export top and bottom copper and silk in 600 DPI pngs
						plugin png --dpi 600
						write top.png=top-copper,top-silk
						write bottom.png=bottom-copper,bottom-silk
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
Once the above subtree is loaded in the config, the following action triggers
the export:
<pre>
cam(call, doc_png)
</pre>
<p id="partial2">
If the command <i>partial</i> appears in the job, a query() is executed
with the expression specified in the command's argument, marking matching
objects with the EXPORTSEL flag. The <i>full</i> command is used to remove
the EXPORTSEL flag from all objects. Note: to export only marked objects,
the <i>write</i> command will typically need the <i>partial</i> supplement.
A typical use case is exporting filled vias in a separate file, using
a custom object attribute called "process":
<pre>
li:pcb-rnd-conf-v1 {
	ha:overwrite {
		ha:plugins {
			ha:cam {
				li:jobs {
					holes {
						desc export all holes in excellon files, sorted by whether they are filled
						plugin excellon
						partial @.a.process == "filled"
						write filled.exc=(partial)
						full
						partial @.a.process != "filled"
						write unfilled.exc=(partial)
						full
						write all.exc
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
</pre>
Note: the first <i>full</i> command is used to cancel the effect of the first
<i>partial</i> command. Without <i>full</i>, at the second <i>partial</i>
all the "filled" vias would still be marked and unfilled.exc would contain
both filled and unfilled vias.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Tips for using with various exporters </h3>
<p>
When exporting to ps, consider using the --no-show-toc. It is
possible to combine multiple layers (e.g. top silk and top copper, which
may be useful for a single-layer board) using the --single-page option.
<p>
The plugin field has the same values command line -x has.
The list of currently available exporter names can be acquired by running
<pre>
pcb-rnd -x
</pre>
Note: this list contains all exporter plugins currently available
(depends on your configure time options and plugin availability). Some export
plugins can not do per layer exporting and those will not support CAM exporting
either.
