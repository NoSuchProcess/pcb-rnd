Requirements:
 1. download and install fungw - svn://repo.hu/fungw/trunk
 2. at the moment fungw must be installed as root, into /usr/local/ or /usr (TODO)
    during configuration, make sure all relevant scripting languages are found
 3. (re)configure and (re)compile pcb-rnd so that it uses the system-installed
    version of fungw instead of the local, no-script version; make sure the
    "script" plugin is compiled (as builtin or plugin)
 4. later on if a new scripting language is required, reconfigure,
    recompile and reinstall fungw - no pcb-rnd recompilation is needed as
    long as the system-installed fungw version is not upgraded
