Create a function <i>hello</i> that will be registered as an action.
The name of the action and the function is always the same. Action names
shall be lowercase.
<p>
When the action is called, use <i>message</i> to append a log message.
<p>
In the "main" section of the script, register the action using fgw_func_reg().
Then save the script cookie and register a new submenu using it. Registering
the submenu with this cookie makes pcb-rnd auto-remove the menu when the script
is unloaded.
<p>
The menu path starts with /main_menu, because it is also possible to
insert menu entries in popups.
