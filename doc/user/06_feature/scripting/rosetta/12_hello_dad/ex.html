Create a function <i>hello</i> that will be registered as an action.
<p>
When the action is called, build a dad dialog called "heldi", with a single
label containing "Hello world!" and a close button that makes the dialog
return 0 when clicked. When the dialog is ran in modal mode,
it will be open and block other pcb-rnd windows until the user closes it.
<p>
Note: the window title (4th parameter of the 3rd dad() call) is displayed
because the root node of the DAD is not a box. For a more complex version,
see 13_hello_dad.
<p>
In the "main" section of the script, register the action using fgw_func_reg().
