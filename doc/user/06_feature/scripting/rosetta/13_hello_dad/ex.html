Create a function <i>hello</i> that will be registered as an action.
<p>
When the action is called, build a dad dialog called "heldi", with a
vertical box that contains two labels "Hello" and "world!". The vbox is
closed by a "end" call to dad(). When the dialog is ran in modal mode, it
will be open and block other pcb-rnd windows until the user closes it.
<p>
Tip #1: change "begin_vbox" to "begin_hbox" to get a horizontal layout.
<p>
Tip #2: boxes can be nested (but each box must have a corresponding "end").
<p>
In the "main" section of the script, register the action using fgw_func_reg().
