Create a function <i>uconv</i> that will be registered as an action.
<p>
When the action is called, build a dad dialog called "uconv". Make sure
there's only one instance of the dialog is created by checking if a dialog
by this name already exists.
<p>
The dialog is built as a horizontal box to split it to left and right. On
the left side there is only a coordinate input box. On the right side there's
a vertical box hosting 3 labels where the results will be displayed.
<p>
<img src="uconv.png" alt="uconv dialog box as rendered by gtk2">
<p>
The widget IDs of the input and the three result labels are saved in global
variables <i>inp, res1, res2</i> and <i>res3</i>.
<p>
Any change on the input will call action "uconv_update", which is also
registered by the script. The update code reads the input field with
the unit set to "mm", then sets the value of the first label (<i>res1</i>)
to this text with a "mm" suffix appended. This is repeated two more times
for two other unit types.
