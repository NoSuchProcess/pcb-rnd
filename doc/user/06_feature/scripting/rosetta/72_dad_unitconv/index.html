<h5> Explanation, step by step </h5>
Create a function 
<i>uconv</i>
 that will be registered as an action. 
<p> When the action is called, build a dad dialog called "uconv". Make sure there's only one instance of the dialog is created by checking if a dialog by this name already exists. 
<p> The dialog is built as a horizontal box to split it to left and right. On the left side there is only a coordinate input box. On the right side there's a vertical box hosting 3 labels where the results will be displayed. 
<p> 
<img src="uconv.png" alt="uconv dialog box as rendered by gtk2"> 
<p> The widget IDs of the input and the three result labels are saved in global variables 
<i>inp, res1, res2</i>
 and 
<i>res3</i>
. 
<p> Any change on the input will call action "uconv_update", which is also registered by the script. The update code reads the input field with the unit set to "mm", then sets the value of the first label (
<i>res1</i>
) to this text with a "mm" suffix appended. This is repeated two more times for two other unit types.
