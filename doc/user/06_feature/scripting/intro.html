<H2 autotoc="yes"> Scripting - User Intro </H2>
This document is an introduction to fungw for pcb-rnd users. It focuses on
scripting pcb-rnd and doesn't discuss fungw deeper than the minimum necessary.
Fungw is more generic than shown here.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Stored scripts </h3>
<p>
Stored scripts are typically larger piece of works that register actions,
may create menus, GUI dialog boxes. Their role is to introduce new
functionality to pcb-rnd - functionality written and shared by users,
using their favorite script language.
<p>
Loading a script using the CLI: run action
<pre>
	LoadScript(id, filename, language)
</pre>
<p>
where id is an arbitrary text ID. The ID is used for referencing the script
once it is loaded. The filename should be a full path (CWD is pcb-rnd's
CWD). Language must be one of the languages configured in fungw.
<p>
Once the script is loaded, it is accessible by calling the actions it
registered using the standard fgw_func_reg() mechanism.
<p>
Scripts can be unloaded using the action
<pre>
	UnloadScript(id)
</pre>
<p>
These operations can also be done using the script browser dialog box, which
is invoked from the menu system or by running action
<pre>
	BrowseScripts()
</pre>
<p>
Stored scripts also can be made permanent, which means they are always loaded
automatically on startup. pcb-rnd loads scripts.lht from the user config
dir (typically ~/.pcb-rnd/) and from the system config dir (typically
/usr/share/pcb-rnd/). This file has the list of scripts to load under
its root <i>li:pcb-rnd-perma-script-v1</i>. Each script is a hash node,
node name is the ID of the script.
<p>
The has nodes have two text children: path and lang. Node <i>path</i>
sepcifies the path to the script file to load; if relative, it is
relative to scripts.lht. Node <i>lang</i> is optional and specifies
the scripting language engine to load for the script - when not specified, a
guess is made based on <i>path</i>.
<p>
For example the user may place foo.awk in ~/.pcb-rnd/scripts/foo.awk and
write the following ~/.pcb-rnd/scripts.lht:
<pre>
li:pcb-rnd-perma-script-v1 {
	ha:bar { path=scripts/foo.awk; lang=mawk; }
}
</pre>
<p>
which will then load ~/.pcb-rnd/scripts/foo.awk using the mawk scripting
engine with the script id <i>bar</i>.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Oneliners </h3>
<p>
Note: examples in this section assume pcb-rnd is configured and compiled
with system <a href="install.txt">installed</a> fungw, and libmawk is also installed
and the libmawk binding is compiled in fungw.
<p>
pcb-rnd also offers script one-liners. A one-liner is a short script
intended to do one thing at the moment of execution. It is typically not
saved in a file and is not recalled later. One-liners are invoked by
the Oneliner action:
<pre>
	OneLiner(awk, 'message("hello")')
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively the language-specific shorthand action can be used; the
following example is equivalent to the above example:
<pre>
	awk('message("hello")')
</pre>
<p>
A third approach, most convenient for experimenting, is switching the
command line interpreter to the given script lagnuage temporarily. For this
the shorthand action (e.g. "awk", "python", "perl") should be exected without
arguments. The promp of the cli changes to reflect the language that will
interpret all the following command lines entered. To leave the script mode,
type "/exit".
<p>
For example:
<ul>
	<li> open the command line (pressing ':' with the default menu config)
	<li> enter <i>awk</i> and press enter - this will switch to awk mode
	<li> enter <i>for(y=1; y &lt; 10; y += 3) { createtext("#1", 0, "1 mm", y " mm", 0, 100, "foo:" y) } </i>
	<li> enter more awk one-liners 
	<li> enter <i>/exit</i> and press enter - this will switch back to the command line

</ul>
<p>
The one-liner mode can be used to get a better command interpreter. After
all, any pcb-rnd action is accessible from any scripting language. For
example the user may choose to switch to awk mode and issue normal
pcb-rnd actions using the awk syntax. The default mode can even be
configured through the conf system, by setting rc/cli_backend to the
language name. However, the CPU and memory footprint of executing a full
script interpreter for each command entered should be noted.
<p>
Limitations: each command line is a separate script context, there are no
script states (e.g. variables) preserved between lines entered. Actions
defined in one-liners are also discarded after the one-liner finished. For
such use cases, stored script shall be written.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Live Scripting </h3>
<p>
Action LiveScript() pops up the Live Scripting window. The script
entered here can be executed, saved or loaded.
<p>
The main use case is experimenting with board edit (object generation)
sctipts: pcb-rnd keeps track of board edits execution may have done and
can undo them. The re-run button combines "undo the effects of the
previous run and run the new version of the script" into a single click.
<p>
Using the persistent mode allows developers to debug, fix and finalize
a script that is intended to be used as a stored script. This mode allows
the script to register actions.

<H2 autotoc="yes"> Scripting - Developer Intro </H2>
<p>

<h3 autotoc="yes"> The big picture </h3>
<p>
The main interface between pcb-rnd internals and the outside world
(e.g. user interface, scripts) is called actions. An action is typically
a function with a few arguments that executes a smallish task. The
actions implemented by pcb-rnd are all functions written in C; some of
the actions are part of core pcb-rnd, others are implemented in plugins.
<p>
GUI operations, menu items, clicking on buttons all call these
actions. The advantage of this system is that the actions are accessible
in an user-interface-independent way: the same operations can be done
with and without GUI, initiated by an user with a mouse or by a script.
<p>
Thus the two main aspects of pcb-rnd scripting are:
<ul>
	<li> defining new actions in script; actions that then can be called from
	     the user interface or from other scripts
	<li> calling pcb-rnd actions from within the script to execute the actual
	     task
</ul>

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Defining actions </h3>
<p>
With fungw, every action is just a native function - the syntax varies
from scripting language to scripting language (see
<a href="rosetta/10_hello/"> the rosetta hello world example</a>). The
arguments of the function are the arguments of the action. The return value
of the function is the return value of the action.
<p>
For the <b>arguments</b>, new actions should try to follow the conventions that
can be found in already existing
<a href="../../09_appendix/action_reference.html"> core actions</a>
for similar purpose.
<p>
The <b>return value</b> depends on the purpose of the action. If the
action is used to calculate something, typically not changing any global
state (e.g. the board), it should return the value calculated, in whatever
scalar native data type the scripting language supports. If the action
is not called to get a value but to perform some changes, the return
value should be an integer: 0 means success, anything else means error.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Calling actions </h3>
<p>
The script may call any action available at a given time, independently
of whether the action is defined in pcb-rnd core, in plugins or in other
scripts. In most scripting languages the action call looks like a simple
function call: function arguments are the action's arguments, the return
value of the function is the return value generated by the action. The calls
are all single threaded, blocking calls. The script may use any scalar native
data type for action arguments without conversion, fungw will take care of
the conversions automatically.

<h3 autotoc="yes"> Action names </h3>
<p>
All action names are registered in lowercase version. The script shall
register lower case function names and action (function) calls should be
spelled lowercase too.
