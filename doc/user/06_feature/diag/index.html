<h2 id=""> Diag plugin </h2>
<p>

The diag plugin provides an integrity check feature to pcb-rnd. The diag plugin
can be run manually or run automatically after each user input. The diag
plugin evaluates all the board data in memory and looks for anythign that seems
strange. Note that using the diag plugin in automated mode will likely slow
down the user experience.

The diagnostic plugin provides a dumpconf action to pcb-rnd.

<!place example usage in diag pool node>
How it can help: sometimes a bug triggers when you edit something, ruins your
data, but you don't figure it until 10 more editing steps. Then we try to
reproduce the problem by repeating the last 2..4 steps, and we fail: everything
looks good. We have no chance to figure the real problem happened 10 steps
earlier. If you auto integrity check is on, it has some chance to capture the
problem right after it happened, so we detect it at that -10th step before it
has to escalate to a segfault or assert.
<---!>

The setting is a normal config setting, you can enable or disable it any time,
from gui, from cli, from config files, from actions. It's called
plugins/diag/auto_integrity - by default it's 0 (off); it runs when it's set to
1.
