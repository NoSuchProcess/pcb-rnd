<h1> pcb-rnd - user manual </h1>

<h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
<p>
pcb-rnd is a highly modular, interactive <i>Printed Circuit Board</i> editor
with a <a href="history.html"> very long history </a>.


<h3> 1.1. Place in the workflow </h3>
<p>
The main purpose of pcb-rnd is to edit the geometry of the board. This
includes board shape, copper shape, layer stackup, holes drilled, slots
routed.
<p>
The <b>input</b> of the layout process is usually a netlist derived from
schematics, and occasionally layouts drawn from scratch or created from
schematic without importable netlist. Pcb-rnd can read different netlist
formats and it can help the user to realize the given netlist in copper or to
change the netlist and back annotate the changes. Pcb-rnd, however, does not
display or edit schematics directly.
<p>
The <b>output</b> of pcb-rnd is most often a vector format (e.g. gerber
RS274D), that is sent to a pcb fab house for manufacturing or is utilized for
auto-fabrication. Pcb-rnd supports a variety of vector and raster output
formats making it easy to print boards, publish them on web pages, and include
them in documentation.

The typical workflows are:

Black flows are the most commonly used; grey flows are possible, fully
supported but less often used in practice.
