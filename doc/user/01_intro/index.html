<h1> pcb-rnd - user manual </h1>

<h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
pcb-rnd is a highly modular, interactive <i>Printed Circuit Board</i> editor
with a <a href="history.html"> very long history </a>.


<h3> 1.1. Place in the workflow </h3>
<p>
The main purpose of pcb-rnd is to edit the geometry of the board. This
includes board shape, copper shape, layer stackup, holes drilled, slots
routed.
<p>
The <b>input</b> of the layout process is usually a netlist derived from
schematics. Pcb-rnd can read different netlist formats and it can help the
user to realize the given netlist in copper or to change the netlist and back
annotate the changes. Pcb-rnd, however, does not display or edit schematics
directly.
<p>
The <b>output</b> is most often a vector format, e.g. gerber, that is sent
to a fab house to get the board manufactured. Pcb-rnd supports a variety
of vector and raster output formats making it easy to print boards, publish
them on web pages, include them in documentation.
