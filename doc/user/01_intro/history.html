<h2> 1.2. pcb-rnd History </h2>
<p>pcb-rnd is a rapid moving independent project started in 2013, but roots
tracing back to the early 90s, to PCB.

<p>
From the pcb.html documentation:
<pre><i>
	<code>Pcb</code> was first written by Thomas Nau for an
	Atari ST in 1990 and ported to <code>UNIX</code> and <code>X11</code> in
	1994.  It was not intended as a professional layout system, but as a tool
	which supports people who do some home-developing of hardware.
</i></pre>

<p>In Fall 2013, Tibor 'Igor2' Palinkas started an
<a href="../../motivation.html">unofficial fork of PCB</a> to make and
share <i>random</i> changes and improvements (hence the name "-rnd"). Over
the following years the fork was officially announced, adopted additional
users, and reached various milestones, including modularization of the code
base, a better configuration system.
<p>
In 2015, the project switched pace: lot of hours invested and many new developers
and contributors joined, pcb-rnd started to grow rapidly. Most of the code base
has been extended, cleaned up or rewritten. 
<p>
In 2016 and 2017 pcb-rnd went on growig in number of developers, contributors
and users. The number of long standing bugs and misfeatures fixed and missing
features implemented grew a lot too. This affected major components
as the plugin system, the I/O (file format support) subsystem and even the
data model pcb-rnd operates on.
<p>
pcb-rnd is part of the ringdove EDA suite.
