<h2> pcb-rnd History </h2>
<p>pcb-rnd is a rapid moving independent project that originated as a fork of the
Pcb codebase.

<p>
From the pcb.html documentation:
<pre><i>
	<code>Pcb</code> was first written by Thomas Nau for an
	Atari ST in 1990 and ported to <code>UNIX</code> and <code>X11</code> in
	1994.  It was not intended as a professional layout system, but as a tool
	which supports people who do some home-developing of hardware.
	Release history and credits for <code>Pcb</code> can be found in
	the documentation files in mainline <code>Pcb</code>, and currently as of this writing at
	<a href="http://pcb.geda-project.org/manual.html">http://pcb.geda-project.org/manual.html</a>
</i></pre>

<p>In Fall 2013, Tibor Palinkas started an unofficial fork of Pcb to make and
share changes and improvements, and over the following years the fork was
officially announced, adopted additional users, and reached various <a href="milestones.html">milestones</a>
