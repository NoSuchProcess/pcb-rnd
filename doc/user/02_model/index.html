<h1> pcb-rnd - user manual </h1>

<h2> 2. Model of the world  </h2>
<p>
pcb-rnd is designed to handle geometric data of a PCB. This section describes
how pcb-rnd represents reality (e.g. copper shapes) in memory.

<h3> 2.1. layers </h3>
<p>
Unlike a <i>physical layer</i>, a pcb-rnd layer has no thickness. It is a
2 dimensional, logical canvas, similar to layers in image manipulation software
like gimp. There are <i>explicit</i> and <i>virtual</i> layers. An explicit
layer contains drawing primitives (objects) placed by the user. The user has
full control over an explicit layer: objects can be added or removed or
changed any time. A virtual layer has no such flexibility: pcb-rnd computes
its content from explicit layers and there's no way to change the result
directly. A layer has a type and a location.
<p>
Layer types are:
<ul>
	<li> copper for signal layers
	<li> silk for silkscreen layers
	<li> outline for the contour of the board and slots and cutouts
	<li> (mask for solder masks - this is a virtual layer)
	<li> (paste for solder paste - this is a virtual layer)
</ul>
<p>
Note: pcb-rnd does not model substrate layers.
<p>
Layer locations are:
<ul>
	<li> top (used to be the "component side" in the age of thru-hole components)
	<li> bottom (used to be the "solder side" in the age of thru-hole components)
	<li> internal (sandiwched between other layers)
	<li> global (affects all physical layers, thus has no specific location)
</ul>
<p>
Not all combination of type and location are supported, for example an internal
silk layer does not make much sense. The table below lists whether a
combination is supported or not.
<p>
