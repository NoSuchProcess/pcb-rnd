<h2> 2. Model of the world  </h2>
<p>
Pcb-rnd is designed to handle geometric data of a PCB. This section describes
how pcb-rnd represents reality (e.g. copper shapes) in memory.

<h3> 2.1. board </h3>
<p>
Each design pcb-rnd handles is a board. The has global properties and hosts
layers. Most drawing primitives (objects) are on layers. This section describes
the most important global properties.
<p>
<b>Board size</b> is given as a width and a height. For rectangular boards
this can be the real board size, but more commonly it is used to simply
determine the on-screen drawing area and the final board dimensions are
specified using the outline layer. If the board is not rectagnular, the
contour must be specified on the outline layer and the board size must be
large enough that the outline fits in it.
<p>
<b>Netlist</b> is the list of logical connections to be realized in copper.
A netlist is a list of named <i>nets</i>. Each net consists of a list of
<i>terminals</i> (pins or pads) to connect. A terminal is given as
elementname-pinname, e.g. U4-7 means "pin number 7 in element called U4".
<p>
<b>Font</b>, which is always embedded in the design file to guarantee
that the file can be ported and will look the same on different hosts.
<p>
Misc editor settings, such as grid size and offset.

<h3> 2.2. layers </h3>
<p>
Unlike a <i>physical layer</i>, a pcb-rnd layer has no thickness. It is a
2 dimensional, logical canvas, similar to layers in image manipulation software
like gimp. There are <i>explicit</i> and <i>virtual</i> layers. An explicit
layer contains drawing primitives (objects) placed by the user. The user has
full control over an explicit layer: objects can be added or removed or
changed any time. A virtual layer has no such flexibility: pcb-rnd computes
its content from explicit layers and there's no way to change the result
directly. A layer has a type and a location.
<p>
Layer types are:
<ul>
	<li> copper for signal layers
	<li> silk for silkscreen layers
	<li> outline for the contour of the board and slots and cutouts
	<li> (mask for solder masks - this is a virtual layer)
	<li> (paste for solder paste - this is a virtual layer)
</ul>
<p>
Note: pcb-rnd does not model substrate layers.
<p>
Layer locations are:
<ul>
	<li> top (used to be the "component side" in the age of thru-hole components)
	<li> bottom (used to be the "solder side" in the age of thru-hole components)
	<li> internal (sandwiched between other layers)
	<li> global (affects all physical layers, thus has no specific location)
</ul>
<p>
Not all combination of type and location are supported, for example an internal
silk layer does not make much sense. The table below lists whether a
combination is supported or not.

<h3> 2.3. layer groups </h3>
<p>
One or more explicit layers form a <i>layer group</i>. All pcb-rnd layers
of a layer group will end up on the same physical layer. The visibility of
layers in a layer group are toggled together. The main use of layer groups
is to exploit that layers have different drawing color on screen: there
can be a signal and a gnd layers with different color in the same layer group,
on the same physical layer.

<h3> 2.4. Basic drawing objects </h3>
<p>
Pcb-rnd supports a small number of basic drawing objects, from which complex
objects can be build. The following figure demonstrates all basic objects:
<p>

<p>

<h4> 2.4.1. Line objects </h4>
<p>
Lines are round ended straight line segments with a width and
a clearance. The above image shows 3 lines connected. Lines are mainly
used to construct traces. A line is always on a specific layer. The user
interface allows drawing lines aligned to 90 or 45 degree axes or
lines with random angle.
<p>
A line is specified by its two endpoints, width and clearance:
<p>
<img src="obj_line.png">
<p>
A <i>clearance</i> is the gap between a line and the sorrunding polygon
in the same layer group. The gap is made only if the sorrunding polygon has
the "clearpoly" flag set and the line has the "clearline" flag set. If either
of these flags is not set, no gap is made - or in pcb-rnd terminology,
the line is joined to the polygon.

<h4> 2.4.2. Arc objects </h4>
<p>
Arcs are round ended circular arcs with trace width and clearance. They
behave like lines in all respects.
<p>
<img src="obj_arc.png">
<p>
Although the arc is described with it's center, radius, start and end
angles, the user interface may offer drawing arcs by endpoints.


<h4> 2.4.3. Polygon objects </h4>
<p>
Polygons are solid, filled copper areas with optional holes in them. Polygon
contour consits of lines - when they look curvy, it's really high resolution
line approximation. There are two type of holes in a polygon: <i>explicit</i>,
user drawn holes and <i>clerance</i> cutouts. User drawn holes are "negative"
polygons drawn manually. To keep polygons simple, if an user drawn hole
touches the contour of a polygon, the hole is removed and the contour is
modified; if two holes touch, they are merged into one hole.
<p>
If the polygon has the "clearpoly" flag set (default), clearance cutouts are
automatically inserted around objects on the same layer group:
<ul>
	<li> lines and arcs, if they have the "clearline" flag set (default)
	<li> vias and pins, if they are not connected to the polygon by thermals
	<li> pads
</ul>
<p>
Overlapping or touching polygons are not automatically merged. An object
with the "clearline" flag set will clear all "clearpolys" it is over -
if there are multiple such polygons overlapping under the objects (on
the same layer group), all such polygons get the clearance cutout.
<p>
If a polgyon is cut into multiple islands, the behaviour depends on the
"fullpoly" flag of the polygon. If it is not set (default), only the largest
island is kept, else all islands are kept. In the "fullpoly" mode islands
will have no galvanic connection (unless the user adds vias and connect them
on another layer), still the program will handle all islands as a single
polygon. This is risky: the program will indicate connection between polygon
islands that are not really connected, only because they are part of the same
polygon!
