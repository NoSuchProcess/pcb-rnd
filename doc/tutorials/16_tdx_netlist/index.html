<h3> Step 1: import the schematics </h3>
<p>
Our schematics is coming from a tEDAx netlist, which is a bit more than
just a list of networks: it also contains information about footprints and
device attributes.
<p>
Start with an empty board and import the schematics information from
7805.tdx using the File menu, Import submenu, Import tEDAx schematics submenu.
<p>
All subcircuits and networks should be loaded.

<h3 id="step2"> Step 2: disperse </h3>
<p>
However, the subcircuits are placed randomly. There are many different
strategies to resolve this:
<ul>
	<li> manual placement: drag&drop move the subcircuits around; you may
	     want to temporarily enable the "floater lock" in the Mode menu,
	     Drawing submenu, "lock floaters" item (or using {m f l}). Since
	     refdes text is normally a floater, this will lock it down to
	     its parent subc so it will be easier to grab the subc to move, not
	     the refdes.
	<li> disperse: Connects menu, Subcircuit placement submenu, disperse all
	     subcircuits. This will place the subcircuits in a grid in random order
	     so that there will be no overlap
	<li> in the same submenu there is an auto-place selected subcircuits item;
	     select all subcircuits (drag-and-drop selection box enclosing them all)
	     then execute this menu. It's a smarter algorithm that is trying to
	     place subcircuits to minimize resulting rat line length. It will
	     try to use both sides of the board.
</ul>

<h3> Step 3 on: lay out the board </h3>
<p>
Once subcircuits are placed, press {c r} and the nets are shown with rat lines.
