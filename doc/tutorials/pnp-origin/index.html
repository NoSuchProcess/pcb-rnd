<H1> pick and place - origin </H1>

<h2> A. simplest case: rectangular board, implicit outline, implicit P&amp;P origin </h2>
<p>
Assume a <a href="orig_impl.lht">board</a> of 775*725 mils needs to be
created. The P&amp;P fab says coord 0;0 is the lower left corner. The board
fab says they need the centerline of tool-path on the outline layer for
milling.
<p>
By far the simplest way to handle this board is to rely on builtin defaults:
<ul>
	<li> board size (width and height) specifies the outline of a rectangular board
	<li> if the outline layer exists but is empty, an implicit rectangular outline is drawn, matching board sizes
	<li> implicit P&amp;P origin is the lower left corner
</ul>
<p>
Setting it up:
<ul>
	<li> 1. start pcb-rnd with no board - this gets the default board template
	<li> 2. change board width &amp; height (gtk: file/preferences/user PoV/sizes)
	<li> 3. do the layout
	<li> 4. when exporting Gerber, enable the 'all layers' option to get the implicit outline layer
	<li> 5. export the xy
</ul>
<p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Pros<th>Cons
<tr>
<td><ul>
	<li> easy to set up
	<li> no need to draw the outline
</ul>
<td><ul>
	<li> limited drawing area - unsuitable for editing small boards
	<li> supports rectangular shapes only
</ul>
</table>

<h2> B. rectangular board, explicit outline, explicit P&amp;P origin </h2>
<p>
Assume another <a href="orig_sq.lht">board</a> of 775*725 mils needs to
be created. The P&amp;P fab says coord 0;0 is the lower left corner. The
board fab says they need the centerline of tool-path on the outline layer
for milling.
<p>
This time the virtual board (canvas, drawing area) will be larger and the
board outline of a 775*725 will be manually drawn. Since pcb-rnd won't make
a guess of where the lower-left corner is, an explicit origin mark
needs to be added for the pick&amp;place process.
Setting it up, assuming the GTK HID:
<ul>
	<li> 1. start pcb-rnd with no board - this gets the default board template
	<li> 2. draw the 775*725 mils box on the outline layer anywhere in the drawing area
	<li> 3. do the layout within this box
	<li> 4. draw a short line on a random layer - this will be the P&amp;P mark
	<li> 5. drag&amp;drop move the endpoint of the unselected mark line to its other endpoint - this will result in a 0 long line, which looks like a filled circle; with 's' increase the size so that it's easily visible
	<li> 6. select the mark, drag&amp;drop move it to the lower left corner of the outline box
	<li> 7. the mark still selected, press ctrl+e and click on the "add attribute" button in the property editor
	<li> 8. type in "pnp-origin" in the "Attribute key" and "yes" in the "Attribute value" field; click ok and close the property editor
	<li> 9. export the Gerber and xy files
</ul>
<p>
There is a <a href="https://archive.org/details/pcb-rnd-xy-origin-sq">video tutorial</a> available on steps 4..8.
<p>
Note 1: the mark is not explicitly visible in the XY file. It is not explicitly
passed to the P&amp;P fab. Instead, all element coordinates are calculated considering
the mark's center as 0;0.
<p>
Note 2: still, the mark is not hidden or suppressed by pcb-rnd from any
of the output. It must be a line, but it can be on any of the layers.
Thus the mark potentially would show up on the board. There are multiple
options to make the mark disappear:
<ul>
	<li> make the mark diameter smaller that the router mill bit diameter and place
	     the mark on a copper layer; the board fab will have the copper dot, but it
	     will be milled away.
	<li> same trick should work with silk as well
	<li> or even on the solder mask layer where this object would be a small cutout over void
	<li> make a new (copper) layer, place the mark there and don't send this layer's Gerber export
       (later on pcb-rnd will support documentation layers which are more dedicated for this sort of use)
</ul>
<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Pros<th>Cons
<tr>
<td><ul>
	<li> drawing area (canvas) is bigger than the board: easier to edit
	<li> can handle slots, cut-outs on the outline layer
	<li> if the pick and place fab requires a slight offset on the placement, it is easy to move the mark
</ul>
<td><ul>
	<li> requires more steps to set up
</ul>
</table>

<h2> C. round board, explicit outline, explicit P&amp;P origin </h2>
<p>
Assume a third <a href="orig_round.lht">board</a> shaped as a 700 mil
diameter circle. The P&amp;P fab says coord 0;0 is the lower left corner of
the bounding box of the circle. The board fab says they need the
centerline of tool-path on the outline layer for milling.
<p>
The process is the same as in example B. The only extra consideration
is how to find the coords of the P&amp;P origin mark; for this the P&amp;P fab
house needs to be consulted.
<p>
There is a <a href="https://archive.org/details/pcb-rnd-xy-origin-round">video tutorial</a> available on using temporary
lines to aid placing the mark for a round lower-left corner.
