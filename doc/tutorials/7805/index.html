		<H3> Step 1: schematics </H3>
		<p>
		<i>The schematics is usually the single source of all logical information:
		footprints, refdes and values and connections (networks or nets).
		A project is just a directory that holds at least the schematics, but
		usually also the pcb layout file and scripts.</i>
		<p>
		Start the new project by creating an empty directory. Draw
		the schematics with any schematics editor supported by pcb-rnd and
		save it in this new directory. On the schematics
		place the following symbols and edit/add these attributes:
		<ul>
			<li> 7805, footprint=TO220, refdes=U1
			<li> 2 pin connector, footprint=connector(1,2), refdes=J1
			<li> 2 pin connector, footprint=connector(1,2), refdes=J2
			<li> polarized capacitor, fooptrint=rcy(200), value=100uF, refdes=C3
			<li> capacitor, fooptrint=acy(200), value=100nF, refdes=C1
			<li> capacitor, fooptrint=acy(200), value=100nF, refdes=C2
			<li> gnd
		</ul>
		<p>
		Arrange and connect the pins as shown below.

<h3> Step 2: export the netlist as needed </h3>
<p>
Depending on the schematics capture software you choose, you may need to
export a netlist that can be imported in pcb-rnd.
<p>

<h3> Step 3: lay out the board </h3>
<p>
Please follow <a href="../16_tdx_netlist/index.html#step2"> the tEDAx netlist
tutorial from step2 </a> for laying out the board.

<h3> Step 4: updates: forward annotation </h3>
<p>
If you need to change the schematics later, re-export it from the schematics
editor and re-import it from pcb-rnd. If the format included importing
footprints, all new footprints will be imported. The netlist will be updated.
press {c r} after the import and update the board to reflect schematics changes.
