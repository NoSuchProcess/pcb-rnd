Milestone A:

- getting started [25]
	- normal workflow (diagram):
	- startup
		- cd to project dir, start pcb-rnd from there (UNIX aspects)
		- save (implicit save as; project directory)
		- explain main window parts, especially the layer selector
		- online support button
	- layer stackup
		- show preferences cross sect
		- drag&drop remove intern layer groups
		- remove extra layers, keep one layer per group for now
		- decide that bottom is gnd, rename layers accordingly
		- mention sizes (but do not deal with it); defaults are good for all techs
	- sch import
		- sch-rnd: import one or more sheets; prefer project.lht
		- hint on other formats
		- mention stdlib footprints are used
		- zoom out for the footprints
		- terminology: subcircuit
		- look at the netlist
		- re-import
	- placement
		- manual placement for this tutorial
		- looking at sch
		- looking at rats nest, {c r}
		- drag&drop move: no need to select
			- accidentally move a floater
			- show undo {u u}
			- lock floaters!
		- grid basics, bottom status line, top coord readout
		- show rotate
		- {c f}
		- show context menu move to the other side, show hotkey
	- routing
		- routing with lines on top layer
			- netlist window disable gnd
			- hover over a pin for pin info/net
			- line refraction with shift
			- line refraction with '/' and menu (bottom status!)
			- routing styles (selection only)
		- via & sides
				- find a crossing show manual via placement + usig the other side
				- tab, shift tab, ctrl tab
				- bottom status
				- via terminology: padstack
		- netlist window re-enable gnd
		- polygon on the bottom side
		- thermals to connect (minimum thermals)
	- draw the outline
	- tune the silk
	- mention export will be handled in a different video

+ advanced routing: arcs and propedit on traces [3]
	- arc example: go around large hole
	- arcs
		- same trace width
		- editing arc angles graphically
	- draw a line, an arc and a via and a rectangle around them
	- open propedit on the line from context menu, show scope
	- explain thickness and clearance
	- close propedit
	- select line, arc, via
	- use {p e} to open propedit, show scope
	- show stats
	- change clearance and trace thickness
	- refer to sch-rnd propedit video

+ show routing style configuration (no padstack yet) [2]
	- select a style
	- draw a polygon, a line and a text
	- name (display name) - [objects don't remember]
	- change geometry, show effect with new objects on the poly
	- show attributes

+ advanced routing with lines [2 -> 4]
	- line refraction:
		- normal, /
		- 90 degree
		- all-direction
	- rubber band modes
	- show clearance: mode/cursor-snap
	- auto-enforce clearance: mode/routing
