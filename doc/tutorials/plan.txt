Milestone D:

+ D1: remove and buffer basics [2]
	- remove tool
	- remove by del (no selection needed)
	- remove by selection
		- menu
		- {s r}
	- cut selection to buffer
	- paste
	- copy selection to buffer

- D2: advanced buffer use [5]
	- buffer transformations
		- copy
		- rotate
	- save buffer content
	- save single footprint
	- save footprint lib
	- loading buffer content
	- loading footprint to buffer
		- what's really happening with the lib window (buffer, library searches)
		- special casing: top/bottom view for placement does matter
		- load file directly from the import menu
	- using multiple buffers
	- buffer survives board switch
	- explain buffer layer bindings
		- copy-paste retains side/layer; demo: smd + wire

+ D3: connectivity [2]
	- preparation
		- place two resistors
		- name them
		- connect pairs of pads with rats and a stub of wire from one resistor
	- {c r}
		- move things around and use {c r} -> always shortest path
		- cause a short with stubs -> {c r} warns
		- mincut vs. no-mincut (requres next release!)
	- {c f}
		- galvanic connections on copper
		- {c f} on another
		- {c f} away or {c c} to clear
		- remove some wires, {c r}
		- ... and rats
		- del the rat, {c f}


- D4: netlist window basics [3]
	- open the window
	- show how nets and pads are visually highlighted
	- select/unslect
	- find/clear
	- rat disable, rat enable (gnd!)
	- all enable/disable
	- single net rat'ing
	- ripup

- D5: netlist window advanced [5]
	- drawing new nets:
		- place and name some subcircuits
		- open the netlist window
		- select the line tool and the rat layer
		- draw the rat
		- show result in the netlist window
	- show back annotation window
	- close back annot window
	- show rename
	- create another net drawing rats
	- merge selected net into another net by name
	- change attrib
	- claim:
		- draw a connection
		- click on claim by different methods
		- enter name for the new net
	- length calc; TODO: buggy, always thinks there's a junction

- D6: advanced thermals [3]
	TODO

- E1: fab layers
- E2: mechanical keepout layers
- E3: doc layers: assy and custom
