Milestone C:

- grid, snap, wireframe [3]
	- red grid dots
	- if not visible set editor/cross_grid
	- crosshair snapping to grid
	- useful for spacing traces and objects
	- change grid spacing:
		- menu view -> grid -> grid size -> tear-off
		- switching up and down in predefined with hotkeys
		- grid unit does not need to match display unit
		- custom grid from menu
	- object endpoint snap
		- draw arc, line, padstack and poly
		- happens best when grid is large
		- line/arc ends
		- line middle
		- polygon corners
		- padstack origin
	- thin
		- wireframe draw with {mdw}
		- thin draw with {mdt}
		- uses:
			- especially useful on mask layers
			- hidden object overlaps like lines going inside polygons and padstacks (smd!)
			- misaligned corner (outline!)
		- selective:
			- {m d p} for poly only
			- per layer from right click transformation


Milestone D:

- remove and buffer basics [2]
	TODO
	(include mirror and arb. rotation)

- advanced buffer use [5]
	- save buffer content
	- save single footprint
	- save footprint lib
	- loading buffer content
	- loading footprint to buffer
		- that's really happening with the lib window
		- but also from the import menu
	- using multiple buffers
	- buffer survives board switch
	- explain buffer layer bindings

- connectivity [2]
	- {c r}
	- {c f}
	- shorts and mincut

- netlist window basics [3]
	TODO

- netlist window advanced [5]
	TODO

- advanced thermals [3]
	TODO



=== advanced ===
