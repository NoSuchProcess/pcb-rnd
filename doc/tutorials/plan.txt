=== basic ===

Milestone B:

- per board and per subc padstack proto lib [5]
	- switch to mm! (the default board has protos defined in mm)
	- place a few vias of different style, multiple of each in a "table"
	- draw poly around them
	- show right-click propedit on the vias: different proto
	- show right-click padstack editor:
		- explain parts of the first tab:
			- show the same proto id
			- rot/mirror doesn't matter with round padstack -> later video
		- explain second tab:
			- per layer shape: grow and shrink internal copper by 0.5mm
			- change hole dia and plating
		- show third tab on a new one:
			- generate a square via to replace this
			- show that the proto number did change
		- first tab: click on the proto id, change proto in this one instance from lib
		- dup id:
			- pick a new pstk that has multiple instances
			- show again that edit proto changes all vias sharing the same proto
			- click on dup, show it got a new number
			- changing now changes only this one
			- but it's easy to pick this proto for any via
		- close the dialog
	- open the board padstack lib dialog fom the edit window
		- same dialog we used for selecting a new proto
		- show edit
			- show generate:
				- show that all vias of the same proto replaced
				- show that the proto number did not change
		- show new
		- show select and switch 
		- show count/del
		- mention load/save and copy/paste
	- place two dip(8)'s
	- right click on one of the dip's round pins, switch to round
	- right click on the subc, padstack proto lib


- poly [5]
	- drawing rectangles
	- drawing arbitrary polygons
		- all-direction line
		- hotkey for close
	- drawing holes
	- explain that hole is part of the polygon object
	- clearances in polygons
		- normal object clearance
		- as-drawn and clipped poly (turn on frame)
		- poly cut into multiple islands
	- editing existing polygons
		- grab a corner
		- ortho-move (shift or ctrl?)
		- show invisible corners with as-drawn frame and hover
		- insert
	- explain there are no pours or planes
	- show poly clipping out of existence

- text [3]
	TODO

- select [3]

Milestone C:

- placing footprints from the lib [5]
	- manual nav
	- placement
	- filter
	- parametric
		- type in
		- gui edit
	- edakrill
	- configuring own library
	- how this interferes with import
		- nonetlist (connector(1) for test pad, logo)

- grid, snap, wireframe [3]
	TODO

- drawing on any layer [3]
	- turning layers on-off
	- turning all layers on-off
	- drawing on any layer
	- explain negative layer
	- moving objects between layers
	- one object is always on one layer, except for subcircuits and padstacks

- outline and cutouts [3]
	TODO

- export to fab [3]
	- cam export to jlc
		- explain gerber + excellon
		- explain file naming
	- export XY

Milestone D:

- remove and buffer basics [2]
	TODO
	(include mirror and arb. rotation)

- advanced buffer use [5]
	- save buffer content
	- save single footprint
	- save footprint lib
	- loading buffer content
	- loading footprint to buffer
		- that's really happening with the lib window
		- but also from the import menu
	- using multiple buffers
	- buffer survives board switch
	- explain buffer layer bindings

- connectivity [2]
	- {c r}
	- {c f}
	- shorts and mincut

- netlist window basics [3]
	TODO

- netlist window advanced [5]
	TODO

- advanced thermals [3]
	TODO



=== advanced ===
- layer compositing
- creating doc layers
- mechanical keepout layers
- doc layers: assy and custom
- fab layers
- subcircuit layer bindings
- footprint creation basics [5]
- TODO: extended objects....
