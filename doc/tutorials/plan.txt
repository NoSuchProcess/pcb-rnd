Milestone B:

- B7 poly [5]
	- drawing rectangles
	- drawing arbitrary polygons
		- all-direction line
		- hotkey for close
	- drawing holes
	- explain that hole is part of the polygon object
	- clearances in polygons
		- normal object clearance
		- as-drawn and clipped poly (turn on frame)
		- poly cut into multiple islands
	- editing existing polygons
		- grab a corner
		- ortho-move (shift or ctrl?)
		- show invisible corners with as-drawn frame and hover
		- insert
	- explain there are no pours or planes
	- show poly clipping out of existence

+ B6 text [3]
	- draw text on anylayer (show a few)
	- show clearance around text in copper
		- (limitations: fixed size bbox clearance0
	- property editor
		- rotation (CCW in degs)
		- scale (integer in percentage)
		- string
		- thickness (for centerline font)
	- {e t} for text edit


+ B5 select [3]
	- click select single object
	- unselect: click away (to another object or to empty)
	- shift+click select multiple objects
	- positive box
	- negative box
	- combininb boxes with shift
	- avoid selection using visibility
	- avoid selection using locking
	- unselect tricks:
		- box selection then shift-click unselect objects
		- invert selection (everything-but-an-island)

Milestone C:

- placing footprints from the lib [5]
	- manual nav
	- placement
	- filter
	- parametric
		- type in
		- gui edit
	- edakrill
	- configuring own library
	- how this interferes with import
		- nonetlist (connector(1) for test pad, logo)

- grid, snap, wireframe [3]
	TODO

- drawing on any layer [3]
	- turning layers on-off
	- turning all layers on-off
	- drawing on any layer
	- explain negative layer
	- moving objects between layers
	- one object is always on one layer, except for subcircuits and padstacks

- outline and cutouts [3]
	TODO

- export to fab [3]
	- cam export to jlc
		- explain gerber + excellon
		- explain file naming
	- export XY

Milestone D:

- remove and buffer basics [2]
	TODO
	(include mirror and arb. rotation)

- advanced buffer use [5]
	- save buffer content
	- save single footprint
	- save footprint lib
	- loading buffer content
	- loading footprint to buffer
		- that's really happening with the lib window
		- but also from the import menu
	- using multiple buffers
	- buffer survives board switch
	- explain buffer layer bindings

- connectivity [2]
	- {c r}
	- {c f}
	- shorts and mincut

- netlist window basics [3]
	TODO

- netlist window advanced [5]
	TODO

- advanced thermals [3]
	TODO



=== advanced ===
- layer compositing
- creating doc layers
- mechanical keepout layers
- doc layers: assy and custom
- fab layers
- subcircuit layer bindings
- footprint creation basics [5]
- TODO: extended objects....
