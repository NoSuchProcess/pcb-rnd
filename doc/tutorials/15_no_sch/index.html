<h3> step 1: place two capacitors </h3>
<p>
Start pcb-rnd - it will start with an empty board (loaded from the
default board, as configured).
<p>
Pan: click with the scroll wheel of the mouse (or middle button) and move
the mouse; alternatively use the scroll bars at the bottom and right
of the editor area. Zoom: scroll wheel.
<p>
Press key w then key l (which will be written as {w l} in this tutorial).
This will open the library window ({w l} is for "window, library"). The
library window has a filter entry on the bottom left: enter
<i>acy(200)</i> there and the preview on the right side will show an
axial lead footprint with 200 mil pin distance. Althought a tpyical
thru-hole ceramic capacitor is not axial lead, it will fit nicely in this
footprint:
<p>

<p>
The footprint is in the paste buffer and the buffer tool is selected
(which is visible on the overhead tool bar under the menu). Place
the buffer on the board by a left click. You can exit the buffer mode
by pressing the escape key or F11.
<p>
The placed footprint is called subcircuit or subc for short. The subc has
a refdes (the main ID of the subc) reading "R1". Grab this "R1" with a
left click and move it out from the middle of the subc and drop it near
the subc so it is readable. Rename the subc to "C1" by pressing {e r}
while hovering the mouse cursor over the subc body (not the refdes text);
{e r} is for "Edit Refdes".
<p>
Select the subcircuit by clicking it - any point where the subcircuit
has graphics would work, within the red dashed subc frame. The subc will
turn cyan. Note: the refdes text is selected separately from the subc. Make
sure to click on the silk screen graphics (black lines) or a pin to
make the whole subc cyan, not just the refdes text.
<p>
Once selected, press {e c} ("edit, copy") which will copy the modified subc
to the buffer and will select the buffer tool. Now place it next to the
original subc and modify its refdes to "C2".
<p>

<h3> step 2: place the rest </h3>
<p>
Place the rest of the subcircuits using the same method. It's best to keep
the library window open for all these placements:
<ul>
	<li> a <i>to220</i>, rename it to <i>U1</i>
	<li> an <i>rcy(200)</i>, rename it to <i>C3</i>
	<li> two <i>connector(1,2)</i>, renamed to <i>J1</i> and <i>J2</i>
</ul>

<h3> step 3: create the gnd net by drawing rat lines </h3>
<p>
To ease laying out the board, we create a net lsit by drawing rats.
Rat lines are logical connections between terminals. A terminal is
a pin or pad of a component, addressed as <i>refdes-termid</i>, where
refdes is the host subcircuit's refdes and termid is the unique temrinal
ID within the subc. The drawing already has unique refdes assigned to
each subc and the stock footprints we worked from already have unique
terminal IDs.
<p>
Note: terminal IDs can be shown or hidden by hovering over the subc or
the terminal and pressing {v n} (for "view name"). The ID shows up printed
over the terminal (pin in our case) with tiny red letters - zoom in to see them.
A tooltip also shows the terminal ID after hovering the mouse cursor over the
terminal for a few seconds<sup>1</sup>.
<p>
Select the <i>Rats</i> layer on the left - it is part of the "Virtual" layer
group on the bottom. Select the line tool on the overhead toolbard
(second icon from the left).
<p>
Start drawing a line from J1's terminal 2 (the round one) by left-clicking it.
Left click C1's terminal 2. This is a new logical connection, a new net, so
a popup dialog will ask for the net name. Enter <i>gnd</i> and press enter.
<p>
The rat line drawing is still active from the last terminal, so go on connecting
C2's terminal 2, J2's terminal 2, U1's middle terminal and C3's negative
terminal. Since these connections are all extending the gnd network, no net name
is asked. When finished, press esc or F11. Don't mind what your rat lines
cross: only the two endpoint of a rat line matter.
<p>

<p>
Press {w n} to open the network window:
<p>

<p>
Note: you can zoom/pan the preview on the top right the same way as the main
drawing. If the network selection on the left changes, the right side is
updated. The preview highlights affected terminals.

<h3> step 4: create the rest of the networks using the same method </h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li> network called <i>in</i>: J1-1, C3-1, U1-1, C1-1
	<li> network called <i>out</i>: J2-1, U1-3, C2-1
</ul>
