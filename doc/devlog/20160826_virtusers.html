<H2> Offer vs. pull (virtual users vs. active users) </H2>
Pcb-rnd has an pulled-by-users policy on deciding what features to implement.
Below I try to explain how we ended up using this policy.

<h3> Past: offer, virtual users </H3>

When I started pcb-rnd, although I published it, I didn't think anyone else
would use it. It was just about having mainline with different default
settings.
<p>
Later on I added a few features, and pcb-rnd slowly became much more than
just different defaults. I felt other users may find the new features useful,
so I had <i>put</i> it on offer: advertised the repository. I thought users
would download and try the software. Judging from the feedback, they didn't. I
didn't mind, becuase I was working on features I needed, to get pcb-rnd do what
I wanted: I was my own target audience and anyone else trying pcb-rnd could
only be a side effect. Until when I ran out of features because it already
had everything I needed.
<p>
The next step was to implement features for other users. Between summer
of 2015 and summer of 2016, I tried to be a bit more proactive: made
public polls to map what users needed and tried to focus implementing
those features. This did not bring too many users either.
<p>
This was when I realized what was really happening: I was <i>offering</i>
features for <i>virtual</i> users, addressing my communication to the wide
auidence. Noone really felt it was for him. Even if he was complaining about
a missing feature in pcb and a few days later I announced the fix in pcb-rnd, it
was not specifically for him, but for the Greater Good.
<p>
Virtual users nearly never became real users. My conclusion was that there
was no point in implementing features for virtual users as noone ever would
use those features.

<h3> Present: pull, active users </H3>
Mid summer 2016, I switched strategy. Instead of polling the crowd, I picked
a few users with known feature requests and asked them if they were willing to
test pcb-rnd if I implemented their feature. More than half of them said yes
and many of them got hooked up. They all became productive, active members
of the pcb-rnd community.
<p>
Learning from this experiece, the new strategy of pcb-rnd is as follows:
<ul>
	<li> pull instead of offer: do not hope a new feature would attract users,
	     rather arrange active users who then pull the project with their
	     feature requests;
	<li> do not invest too much time in anything that is not currently pulled
	     by actual, existing, active users; rather invest that time in fulfilling
	     the needs of already existing users
	<li> reaching 100 users with an average of 0.1% activity will result in
	     0 active useres whereas reaching only 10 users with 30% activity
	     will result in 3 active users; thus a small active communit around
	     pcb-rnd is more efficient than the much larger geda community;
	<li> users really appreciate fast response on bugreports and feature requests.
	     Instead of trying to impress virtual users, rather keep already interested
	     users happy.
</ul>
