<H2> How github promotes confusion </H2>
<p><font size=-2>by Igor2</font></p>
<p>
Pcb-rnd is hosted in an svn repository (at svn://repo.hu/pcb-rnd) -
<b>there is no official git or hg or bazaar repository</b>. As
it is free software, people are encouraged to make and distribute copies.
Majority of the cases such behavior is beneficial for users: e.g. when
a Linux distro packages pcb-rnd, helping its users to run it or even
when an user makes a mirror repository, clearly marked as a mirror.
<p>
I also encourage everyone who doesn't like the ways of pcb-rnd but does
like the code, to fork the project: copy the repository or the code,
rename it, make whatever modification and publish it.
<p>
There is only one use pattern I find harmful: when someone makes a
fork, clone or mirror without clearly marking it being a copy. Unfortunately
this has happened on github and gitlab: an user cloned a very old
version of pcb-rnd and called it simply pcb-rnd. This matters because
popular web search engines assign high scores to projects hosted on
github. A potential user who hears about pcb-rnd not from us (the dev team),
will not know the URL of the project and will use a web search, which then
promotes github from where he will pull and old version. He may later read
the doc and figure it's just a random copy of an old version, and go
and get the latest from the official site, but the point is:
<ul>
	<li> he has wasted some time on the wrong version
	<li> other than being a "honey pot" for unlucky users, such an old copy does not have any benefit for the users or developers
	<li> the only potential winner of such a deal is github, harvesting some more clicks
</ul>
<p>
But the real lesson learned for me was not this, but how github is not
motivated in avoiding such confusion.
<p>
The first meta text on the github page says: 
<pre>
"Contribute to pcb-rnd development by creating an account on GitHub."
</pre>
This is clearly a lie - that's <b>not</b> how you contribute - instead,
contribution is via svn commits and IRC. Unfortunately google picks up
the same setence so this false information is on the first page of
a google search on "pcb-rnd".
<p>
I first tried to contact the author to ask him to rename his fork; github
is not helping much in that: there's no contact info for the user, not
even a captcha-protected email or "send a message" form. I'd expect such
a service was designed to help people work together, which does include
contacting others. 
<p>
So I went on and found the problematic user's email from other sources.
I tried to contact him a few times but he ignored my attempts.
<p>
After seeing an actual user getting confused on the said github project, I
decided to contact github and see if they are willing to help in renaming the
repository to avoid confusion. Well, they are not. I got an answer from the
support that made it clear they did not even read the request, just copied
some stock answer. After getting through that layer,they said I should file
a DMCA take-down request; I asked them whether they think it would apply in case
of GPL projects but they said they can't answer that and I should consult a
lawyer! But after reading their own material on DMCA it's pretty clear they
would simply do nothing even if the said user actually committed copyright
infringement.
<p>
So my conclusion is: if you ever want to get a project hosted, <b>do NOT
choose github</b>, because:
<ul>
	<li> the support doesn't help at all (they don't even read what you write, just send some semi-automatic answer first)
	<li> they are not really interested in serving the community or the users, but in being the biggest, getting the most clicks - if the path to that is maintaining confusion, that's fine for them
	<li> they don't seem to care much about users who are not registered or not wanting to do pull requests - to an extent that contacting authors is pretty much impossible as an "outsider"
</ul>
Looking at gitlab, I see similar tendencies. Repo.or.cz looks a bit better,
at least there the owner of a repo has an email address.
<p>
(All the above is obviously my personal opinion based on my personal experience.)
