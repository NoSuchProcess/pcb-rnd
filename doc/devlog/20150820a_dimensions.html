<h2> fp2anim dimensions </h2>
<p><font size=-2>by Igor2</font></p>
<p>
After attacking the qfn()/qfp() parametric footprint problem today,
I realized fp2anim lacked a very important feature: dimension lines.
The footprint being generated is to match the datasheet. Checking the match
requires visible dimensions.
<p>
The new feature of fp2anim is to optionally display custom dimensions on
the preview. Generator scripts print #dimension comments in the footprint
file (not breaking the file format). The generator passes on a dimension
name along with the value. As a first attempt my conventions are:
<ul>
	<li> add dimension lines for dimension type input parameters
	<li> add dimension lines for calculated dimensions if they are likely to be informative and be included in the datasheet
</ul>

<h2> fp2anim vector font </h2>
While working on the dimensions, I realized I had to switch to vector fonts:
the built-in pixel font of animator can not be rotated. The size of a vector
font text can be calculated, which also enables fp2anim to optionally place
semi-transparent bars behind the text to make it more visible on dark background
(like pads).
