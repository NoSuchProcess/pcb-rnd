<H2> "valgrinding" flex/bison parsers </H2>

In a flex/bison parser it's quiet common that strings are allocated
in flex, passed on to bison and then either free'd there or saved in
the output data. Since both free and save happens a lot, it's not an
easy mechanical review of the .y file to find the reason for leaks. Especially
if the code has to store some strings in temporary storage until a later
stage of the parsing.
<p>
A typical valgrind log for such a leak looks like this:
<pre>
==20520== 20 bytes in 1 blocks are still reachable in loss record 3 of 6
==20520==    at 0x402B0D5: calloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:623)
==20520==    by 0x80E6EF0: yylex (parse_l.l:177)
==20520==    by 0x80E0D6C: yyparse (parse_y.tab.c:1696)
==20520==    by 0x80E85ED: Parse (parse_l.l:292)
==20520==    by 0x80E876B: ParsePCB (parse_l.l:347)
==20520==    by 0x8078591: real_load_pcb (file.c:390)
==20520==    by 0x80787E9: LoadPCB (file.c:459)
==20520==    by 0x8097719: main (main.c:1781)
</pre>

The code at <i>parse_l.l:177</i> is just a calloc() and some string
operation: this is where the string is created. The STRING token is
referenced about 58 times in the grammar. After reading through the
whole file 4..5 times, I still didn't see any obvious place for the leak.
<p>
The leak was also a rare one: happened for one string per file. This suggested
it was in the header - unless there's an one-instance object somewhere in the
.pcb or it's a cache where the same pointer is free()'d and overwritten for
multiple occurrences and simply no one free()'s the last.
<p>
Assuming it's a header, a cheap ways to find which header field leaked:
<ul>
	<li> remove the header lines one by one and see if the leak is still there - won't work if a missing header changes how the whole code runs
	<li> change the size of each header, one by one, and see which action changes leak size - a lot of iterations, and valgrinding is slow
</ul>
<p>
At this point I figured that I'd depend on the reported <i>size</i> of the leak
with my tests. I didn't want to do multiple runs and didn't want to risk 
the whole parser to run differently so I didn't want to modify the input. Instead
I figured there's a simple, yet generic way to track these sort of leaks.
<p>
I estimated no string in the file is longer than 1000 characters. Right above
the calloc() in the lexer I introduced a new static integer variable starting
at 1000, increased before each allocation. This counter is sort of an ID of
each allocation. Then I modified the calloc() to ignore the originally calculated
string length and use this ID for allocation size. I also printed the ID-string
pairs. The original code looked like this (simplified):
<pre>
	/* ... predict string size ... */
	yylval.str = calloc(predicted_size, 1);
	/* ... build the string here ... */
	return STRING;
</pre>

The resulting code looked like this (simplified):
<pre>
	/* ... predict string size ... */
	static int alloc_id = 1000;
	alloc_id++;
	yylval.str = calloc(alloc_id, 1);
	/* ... build the string here ... */
	fprintf(stderr, "STRING: %d '%s'\n", alloc_id, yylval.str);
	return STRING;
</pre>
I saved the list printed on stderr and checked valgrind's log to find
the two strings in question were ID 1002 and ID 1007, both looked
something like this:
<pre>
1,3,4,c:2,5,6,s:7:8
</pre>
The only thing that looks like this is the layer group description ("Groups()").
From this point it was trivial to find the bug in the grammar.
