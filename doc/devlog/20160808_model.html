<H2> How to represent the world in pcb-rnd </H2>

<H3> Proper implementation </H3>

&lt;daydreaming&gt;
<p>
In a proper model there's no element/footprint. There are a few simple 
primitives and there are groups, like the ones in svg: groups contain 
metadata, primitives and groups.
<p>
An element is just a group. The whole design may contain groups of groups 
of groups. A stereo amplifier may be a group for a PSU and two instances 
of a single-channel amp group that match square-unit to square-unit.
<p>
What makes up an element now is a refdes, its pins/pads we can identify 
(for the netlist-related things) and the feature that you can drag the 
whole thing as one. A group could do all these as well: refdes is just 
metadata, silk lines are just primitives, pins/pads are just small groups 
of primitives and metadata.
<p>
There could be "group types" and type-specific code handling them. In such 
a setup you probably don't need to have a text object: just a group that 
consists of mostly lines (or polygons) and some metadata (the string 
version of the text); the group type would assigns the text-handling code 
with to the group. So for the rest of the code, text is not a special 
thing, not a bounding box, but just a set of primitives. When you edit it, 
you can edit it either line-by-line or as text with the assigned code.
<p>
This would allow us to have a very small amount of primitives: line, arc, 
poly, hole (without a ring - a via is just a group of a few primitives). 
Each primitive would have a layer-span field; this would solve the 
blind/buried via question for good. (In theory line and arc could be one 
thing, spline oslt, but I don't think performance penalty is worth that.)
<p>
However, this means a total rewrite as almost every non-trivial piece of 
the code depends on the object model, from find/search/drc to the whole 
polygon code, just to name two huge ones. The file format thing is the 
smallest of this all. The only major parts I think we could keep are the 
GUI and the new conf system. At the current rate of development this would 
take more than a year to have a mostly working version and probably yet 
another year to get everything tested out and reach current level of 
service again.
<p>
I am not against such a rewrite, but it would really need a very strong 
user/tester backing and maybe more developers than the current amount.
<p>
Also, Imagine we'd have a pcb program you couldn't trust on 
anything: e.g. losing your data, generating broken gerber, etc. for a very 
long time...
<p>
So I generally agree that we should do this, but for practical reasons I 
am a bit skeptic whether this would work out in the current situation. 
It'd kill any cschem plans for years, and because of the long development 
cycle it would most probably kill pcb-rnd too.
<p>
&lt;/daydreaming&gt;

<H3>Improper implementation</h3>

However, I see an alternative that is not as good as the real thing, but 
might be good enough that users don't see much difference. It's 
possible to implement it step by step, without long years of "nothing 
works as used to" phases. The alternative is:
<p>
<ul>
<li>1. Add io_lihata, first as a second native file format option, but long 
term as the primary file format; it's because we can't really extend the 
code without breaking compatibility with mainline on the .pcb format. In 
other words, we either _pretend_ we are compatible, but using any new 
feature would break compatibility (current state) or we admit that new 
features are implemented only in the lihata syntax and when you save to 
.pcb it's like saving png from gimp, losing some extra layer info. This 
step will happen either way, for other reasons.

<li> 2. rearrange some internals; the core is currently split per operation
(e.g. there's create.c for creating all sort of objects and remove.c
for removing them). The new setup should be per object type (e.g. arc.c
that knows how to create or remove arcs).

<li>3. Once lihata is in place, we can extend/rewrite some parts. An option 
is to rewrite footprint support to allow them to be sort of a small pcb 
design. So objects on arbitrary layers, footprint-in-footprint, etc.

<li>4. When 3. is done, we could extend element handling so that pcb-rnd knows 
which element is there for why. So you could have some real elements, with 
refdes, part of the netlist, etc, but you could also do a panelization as 
a matrix of full pcb designs place like if they were elements.
</ul>
<p>
This 3.,4. would not be the same as building up everything from generic 
atoms, but would be close to it and would be much simpler to implement 
(still a big one, tho). I believe in practice, for end users, it would 
probably be 99% the same as the proper solution.
<p>
I believe 3.,4. would be more or less the pcb-rnd equivalent of gschem's 
implementation of schematics and symbols with about the same level of 
generalism. Not perfect, but maybe good enough.
