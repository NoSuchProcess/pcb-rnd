User requested (accepted):
	- silk over mask or paste [Vuokko]
	+ zone poly based short/broken test; ml=3926 [Vuokko]

Cheap tests, need custom func:
	- text containing non-render chars

Possible tests (old):
	- non-pstk paste object over mask or silk
	- non-pstk paste object over hole?
	- polygon hair, polygon too thin - Gabriel's example: mask being too thin between smd pads
	- top/bottom copper keep-away from outline layers (peel-off on cutting with some fabs)
