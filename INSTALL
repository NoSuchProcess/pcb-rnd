1. Installation

Run ./configure.

You may want to edit config.manual.h and globalconst.h to change
user preference defaults.

Run make.

Run make install.


2. Running from source

cd src && ./pcb-rnd

(Note: it is important to cd to src to run pcb-rnd from source; src/pcb-rnd
won't work unless pcb-rnd is installed).

PCB is organized into a core program that deals with all of the internal
database procedures and a collection of plugins, of which a few are Human
Interface Devices (HID's). The HID's provide exporting/printing
capabilityas well as a graphical user interface.  At the time of writing
this document PCB includes the following HIDs:

HID's:
     gtk -- GTK based GUI.  This is the default GUI.  You will
            need gtk-2.4 or newer installed (both the runtime
            files as well as the developer headers).  You only
            need gtk if you want the gtk HID.

     lesstif -- motif/lesstif based GUI.  To use the lesstif HID
                you will need Motif, OpenMotif, or Lesstif installed.
                Again you need both libraries and headers.

     batch -- no GUI; read commands oin stdin.

     ./configure will compile all HIDs for which the dependencies are
     available - look at the summary at the end to see which ones found.
     It's possible to manually disable HIDs with the --disable-lesstif,
     --disable-gtk and --disable-batch. It's also possible to build
     them as shared objects (dynamic loadable plugin): --plugin-lesstif,
     --plugin-gtk, --plugin-batch for ./configure.

Export plugins:
     ps       -- Postscript and Encapsulated Postscript output.  No
                 additional libraries are needed for this.

     gcode    -- CNC G-CODE output (experimental).  The gdlib library
                 is used by this HID.  gdlib may be found at
                 http://www.libgd.org

     gerber   -- RS-274-X (Gerber) and Excellon drill output.  No
                 additional libraries are needed for this.

     bom      -- Bill of materials (BOM) and Centroid (X-Y) output.
                 No additional libraries are needed for this.

     png      -- png/gif/jpeg output.  This HID uses gdlib to do
                 the majority of the work.  gdlib may be obtained
                 from http://www.libgd.org.

Printer plugins:

     lpr     -- Unix line printer support.  No additional libraries are
                needed for this.


NOTE: plugins can be enabled as buildin (compiled into the main executable),
plugin (dynamic loadable) or disabled (not compiled at all). Please refer to
the output of

  ./configure --help

for the most up to date details on the options.


After running ./configure with your selected options, run

  make

to build pcb-rnd.  You can try out the program by running

  cd src
  ./pcb-rnd

prior to installation.

To install PCB after it has been built run:

  make install

from the top level directory. An alternative installation method
is the link-install, which places symlinks instead of copying files so
no subsequent make install is needed after a recompilation if no new
files appeared (useful for developers):

  make linstall

-------- Summary of dependencies --------------------
For users:
 - C compiler
 - make
 - optional: glib and gtk if you are using the gtk frontend
 - motif or lesstif if you are using the lesstif frontend
 - gdlib if you are using the png HID

For developers:
 - flex
 - bison
