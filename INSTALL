1. Configure

Run ./configure.

Run make.

Run make install.

For compile-time options run ./configure --help.

Dependencies: almost none. For GUI, install the (-dev or -devel) libs
Read the summary table and the warnings at the end of ./configure output
and decide if you need the features missing. If there was no error, only
warnings, pcb-rnd cab be compiled, even if some dependencies were missing.

Summary of dependencies:
For users:
 - mandatory: C compiler
 - mandatory: make
 - optional: glib and gtk2 if you are using the GTK GUI
 - optional: gtkglext if you need opengl rendering
 - optional: motif or lesstif if you are using the lesstif frontend
 - optional: gdlib if you want to export/import to/from png, jpg or gif

For developers:
 - flex
 - bison

NOTE: if you did not install any GUI lib dependency, pcb-rnd will be
compiled with command line interface only.

./configure will try to static link most plugins and disable ones that
have missing dependencies. This process can be controlled using configure
command line switches, see ./configure --help.


2. Compiling

Run make.

Optionally also run make test.


3. Running from source

cd src && ./pcb-rnd

(Note: it is important to cd to src to run pcb-rnd from source; src/pcb-rnd
won't work unless pcb-rnd is installed).

If this doesn't work, please refer to doc/UNIX.txt or doc/mac.txt


4. Installation

To install PCB after it has been built run:

  make install

from the top level directory. An alternative installation method
is the link-install, which places symlinks instead of copying files so
no subsequent make install is needed after a recompilation if no new
files appeared (useful for developers):

  make linstall
