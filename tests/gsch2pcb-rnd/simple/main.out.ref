    You will find all your footprints in a bundle ready for you to place
    or disperse with "Select -> Disperse all elements" in PCB.

2.  From within PCB, select "File -> Load netlist file" and select 
    main.net to load the netlist.

3.  From within PCB, enter

           :ExecuteFile(main.cmd)

    to propagate the pin names of all footprints to the layout.
