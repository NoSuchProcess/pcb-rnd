# Validation state of references
#
# Each line is a file from ref/, in the following format:
#  The first word is the file name, relative to ref/
#  The second word is either "good" or "bad"
#  The third word is the revision number the output file had at the moment of
#   check (the "Last Changed Revision line in 'svn info ref/filename')
#  The rest of the line is a real short summary on whaty's broken, if the
#   second column was "bad".
#
# There's no particular order of lines. If you recheck a file, edit the exiting
# line, each ref file should have only one line in this file. If you are doing
# checks, please insert new lines somewhere in the list, preferrably not at the
# end, so we can avoid svn conflicts in concurrent edits.
#
# Test method: open the .pcb file with pcb-rnd, open the ref/ file with
# the appropriate viewer, look at them side by side and decide if the reference
# output fully matches the input, in all relevant details. What relevent
# details are can be file format specific.
