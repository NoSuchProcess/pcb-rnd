Plan (parallel threads of development):

	A. file format and model
		Steps:
			1. lihata persistency
			2. native lihata file format
			3. extend the file format
				- everything should have an attribute hash -> W6
				- footprints should have optional attachments (e.g. 3d models) -> W5
		This helps us testing out the persistent-lihata idea that'd be
		later used in chscem from the start -> W1

	B. visible attribute support
		Steps:
			1. GTK dialog box for attribute edition
			2. search & select should work by attribute
			-> W6
