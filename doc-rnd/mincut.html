<h1> pcb-rnd - the [mincut] patch </h1>

The original code was highlighting pins/pads only when a short came around
after rats nest optimization. This was not very helpful on a complex board.
There had been a long discussion on the mailing list about the best solutions.
There were a few very good ideas, including:
<ul>
	<li> manual tagging of objects (lines, polys, arcs, vias) with net and warn
	     where two differently tagged net connects
	<li> automatic tagging based on "where it was connected first", then the same
	     warning mechanism as above
	<li> trace history (using the undo buffer?) and go back until when it was
	     not broken, check what exactly broke it
	<li> history combined with tagging
	<li> calculate minimal cut
</ul>
<p>
I choose minimal cut for my patch because it doesn't require tracing the
full history or any manual administration of nets vs. objects (which I
would find inevitable even with manual tagging - directly or indirectly
the user needs to be able to change net tags).
<p>
The minimal cut is the least amount of object whose removal would resolve
the short. It is best demonstrated on an example:
<p>
<img src="mincut.png">
<p>
Removing all the marked lines/polys/vias would surely resolve the short
(sometimes leaving rat lines behind). Minimal cut is better than randomly
removing objects, tho: it guarantees that the minimal amount of objects
are to be removed. On a complex board, this place is likely to be close
to the place where the problem really is - much closer than the pins/pads.
