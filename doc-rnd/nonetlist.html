<h1> pcb-rnd - the [nonetlist] patch </h1>

The [nonetlist] patch adds an element flag that makes PCB ignore the marked
element when dealing with netlists. This means connecting a net to a pin of
a nonetlist element will not cause a short. The refdes of a nonetlist
part is drawn with color element-color-nonetlist (ElementColor_nonetlist
in the source; default value #777777, grey).
<p>
Uses of the nonetlist feature:
<ul>
	<li> smd jumper: Combined with <a href="intconn.html">the [intconn]</a> patch, this
	     solves the "0-ohm 1206 jumper" problem: the element should be marked
	     as nonetlist, with both pins set intconn(1) - this will result in a 2
	     pad element, pads internally connected, that can be part of any one network
	     without causing short.
	<li> mechanical parts that should not show up on the schematics:
		<ul>
			<li> mounting hole elements: single pin holes with silk marking the head of the screw
			<li> chassis (often with mounting holes or keep-out areas)
			<li> logos in footprints (no poly support in footprint - yet?)
			<li> mechanical parts which do not have solderable pins (plastic spacers, extra connector shields)
			<li> "spare parts", e.g. unused/disconnected DIP sockets or pin grids or connectors in a corner of the PCB for prototyping (dev-board style)
		</ul>
</ul>

<h2> save/load and compatibility </h2>
This patch introduces a new element flag. The following example demonstrates
a <a href="jumper_1206.fp">1206 jumper footprint</a>:
<pre>
Element[0x00000000 "1206 jumper, 0 ohm" "" "1206" 0 0 -3150 -3150 0 100 "nonetlist"]
(
	Pad[-5905 -1181 -5905 1181 5118 2000 5718 "1" "1" "square,intconn(1)"]
	Pad[5905 -1181 5905 1181 5118 2000 5718 "2" "2" "square,intconn(1)"]
	ElementLine[-2362 -3740 2362 -3740 800]
	ElementLine[-2362 3740 2362 3740 800]
)
</pre>
Vanilla PCB will load the design ignoring internal connections and nonetlist
flag - this will cause shorts on all connected pins/pads and will break
the connection.
<p>
Vanilla PCB doesn't save nonetlist and elements are embedded in the file -
once the design is loaded and saved with vanilla PCB, the flag is lost.
After reloading the file in pcb-rnd, the element causes the same shorts
as in vanilla PCB.

<h2> plans </h2>
Implement change/action/hotkey for toggling this flag.
