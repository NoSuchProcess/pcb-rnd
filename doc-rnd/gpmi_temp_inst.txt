GPMI manual install

The installation process is somewhat manual at this early stage. Please 
follow the steps below.

First, you'll need libgpmi - it's a general purpose script glue interface.

1. svn checkout svn://repo.hu/gpmi/trunk gpmi/trunk
2. look at doc/languages.txt there; if you have preferred languages, 
please install the -dev packages of those. My favorite is mawk, but I 
think most of the example pcb scripts would be in lua. Versions should 
match; it may be that gpmi works with a newer minor version out of the 
box, tho.
3. run ./configure
4. check if it found the language(s) you wanted; if not, or anything 
else breaks, please send me your scconfig/config.log
5. make
6. make install (as root, but see below)

There are options to step 6:

- if you want to check what it'd do, you could run this:

   install_root=/tmp/foo make install

   it's like DESTDIR for autotools: it will do everything but will use
   /tmp/foo instead of / so you see what it'd do without using root or
   messing with /usr

- you can use make linstall instead of make install; this creates symlinks 
(pointing to the binaries in your user checkout) instead of copying the 
files. If gpmi changes and you need to update and recompile, you won't 
need to reinstall (until the number of files change).

- I don't have --prefix yet, so things go under /usr; if you want to 
install under /usr/local or /opt or wherever, please let me know and I'll 
add the option in ./configure

- there's a make uninstall, but it's more or less untested (failed once 
and worked once for me)

Second, you need pcb-rnd:

1. svn checkout svn://repo.hu/pcb-rnd/trunk pcb-rnd/trunk
2. ./configure
3. check the output; if anything went wrong, please send me 
scconfig/config.log
4. make
5. you don't need to install it for testing: cd src; ./pcb-rnd

Please test whether it works before moving on to the next steps.

Third, the scripting stuff is a plugin which is already part of the source 
tree but is not yet integrated (./configure doesn't know about it and it 
needs some manual steps). So compile and "install" the plugin (all in 
pcb-rnd/trunk):

1. mkdir -p src/plugins/pcb-rnd-gpmi
2. cd src/pcb-gpmi
3. ./configure
4. make
5. copy all the .so and .h files from src/pcb-gpmi/gpmi_plugin/gpmi_pkg 
to src/plugins/pcb-rnd-gpmi (you can symlink instead of cp so a recompile 
won't need a "reinstall")
6. copy (or symlink) src/pcb-gpmi/gpmi_plugin/gpmi_plugin.so to 
src/plugins/gpmi_plugin.so
7. run pcb-rnd from source; it will look for plugins in ./plugins (at the 
end of the search list) and will find and load gpmi_plugin.so
8. you should have a new menu donated by the plugin:
    Plugins/GPMI scripting/Scripts

Note: once we finish alpha testing and the major bugs are ironed out, I'd 
make the installation process much simpler. Pcb-rnd's ./configure 
would detect gpmi and if found, the plugin would be automatically compiled 
(maybe even linked into pcb-rnd). There'd be an svn branch and probably 
distribution tarballs that have both the relevant gpmi checkout and 
pcb-rnd checkout in the same tree and single central ./configure and 
make scripts to compile and install them both.
