<h2> scripting </h2>
Most of the infrastructure for a scriptable pcb had been there in pcb-gpmi.
I had also finished some gpmi cleanup and pcb 
(<a href="20150731a_menu.html">menu</a> and 
<a href="20150801a_events.html"> events </a>) subprojects last week.
These made it easier to get to reach the current status after a weekend
coding marathon:
<ul>
	<li> dialog boxes for managing (loading/unloading) scripts -- check out the videos:
<a href="https://archive.org/details/Pcb-rndManageScriptsDialog"> list scripts and get details </a> or 
<a href="https://archive.org/details/Pcb-rndLoadScript"> load a new script </a>


	<li> import, test, extend the glue layer; scripts can:
	<ul>
		<li> register new actions
		<li> create new menus and submenus
		<li> execute existing actions
		<li> pop up simple dialog boxes (message, report, progress bar, file selection) -- <a href="https://archive.org/details/Pcb-rndCarcScript"> check out the video </a>
		<li> build and pop up custom dialog boxes (so called attribute dialogs)
		<li> search for objects (lines, arc, polys, vias, etc.) on the layout
		<li> create new objects on the layout
		<li> change "page" properties (dimensions of the board)
		<li> debug draw on the gui (slightly broken on gtk due to some gtk hid bugs)
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
My example scripts are written in <b>awk</b>, <b>lua</b> and <b>tcl</b>
at this point, but gpmi supports 7 other languages
(<b>scheme</b>, <b>stutter (lisp)</b>, <b>pascal</b>, <b>perl</b>
<b>php</b>, <b>python</b>, <b>ruby</b>) which are also available in
pcb-rnd.
