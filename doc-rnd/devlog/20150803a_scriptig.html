<h1> pcb-rnd devlog </h1>
<h2> scripting </h2>
Most of the infrastructure for a scriptable pcb had been there in pcb-gpmi.
I had also finished some gpmi cleanup and pcb 
(<a href="20150731a_menu.html">menu</a> and 
<a href="20150801a_events.html"> events </a>) subprojects last week.
These made it easier to get to reach the current status after a weekend
coding marathon:
<ul>
	<li> (TODO:link video) dialog boxes for managing (loading/unloading) scripts
	<li> import, test, extend the glue layer; scripts can:
	<ul>
		<li> register new actions
		<li> create new menus and submenus
		<li> execute existing actions
		<li> (TODO:link video) pop up simple dialog boxes (message, report, progress bar, file selection)
		<li> build and pop up custom dialog boxes (so called attribute dialogs)
		<li> search for objects (lines, arc, polys, vias, etc.) on the layout
		<li> create new objects on the layout
		<li> change "page" properties (dimensions of the board)
		<li> debug draw on the gui (slightly broken on gtk due to some gtk hid bugs)
	</ul>
</ul>
