<H2> Fork FAQ </H2>

This document contains my short answers to questions commonly popping up
in endless flamewars on the geda mailing list. <b>The purpose of this
document is not to convince anyone about any of the questions</b>, only
to save me typing the same answers when someone asks me
one these questions for the 100th time. As I don't want to convince you
that my answers are the best ones, please don't try to convince me that
they are bad. Been there, done that, never worked in either way: e.g.
I never convinced any git fanboy to switch to svn, and they never
convince me to switch to git.

<H3> 1. Why did you fork? </H3>

<H4> 1.1. Fragmentation is bad, your fork is harmful! </H4>
I agree that fragmentation is bad. I believe the some aspects of
the current project management and especially the choice of VCS inevitably
leads to forks (just look at how many git forks are out there!). Such
fragmentation of developer and user resources may be bad for a project.
However, these decisions are not mine: the project is set up like
that, I can't change it
<p>
My fork is just a fork, just like any of the other forks. My fork happens to
be in an svn repository. I don't think it changes anything important from the
mainline's point of view.

<H4> 1.2. ... but how will you get all these merged with mainline? </H4>
I won't. I haven't really used the official, current mainline since like
2011. I don't really care in what directions it evolves or whether it
takes features, code or ideas from pcb-rnd or not.

<H4> 1.3. ... but you are in the best position for a merge! </H4>
I don't think so. I know my changes, but I don't know the changes happened
in the mainline since ages. I am also not efficient with git. It wouldn't
take me any less time than for mainline developers. Also please read point 1.2.:
I have no motivation in spending any time on a merge.

<H4> 1.4. Ok then, but you won't have too many users. </H4>
Fine. My main intention was to produce a pcb editor for my own use. I am
happy if it's also useful for others, so I publish it. Having users
may increase code quality - but other than that, I don't get paid for having
more users, the project doesn't die if I code it alone, so I am not worried
about this.

<H4> 1.5. I'd like to merge something from pcb-rnd to mainline </H4>
Go ahead. I can help you by explaining my code. I won't generate
patches, make changes to get my code compatible with the mainline or
test how it performs in mainline versions.

<H4> 1.6. I'd like to merge something from mainline to pcb-rnd </H4>
If the feature is in line with the goals of pcb-rnd, fine, I'll ive
you svn commit access from day 0.

<H3> 2. git: did you know... </H3>

Preface: I don't try to convince you not to use git in your project; in
return, please don't try to convince me I should use git in mine.

<H4> 2.1. ... that there was an svn frontend to git? </H4>
Yes. 2/3 of my problems with git and DVCS in general are not of technical
nature. I know the <b>concepts</b> of DVCS and I find them suboptimal in
case of small teams. A different UI or a good document won't help in that.

<H4> 2.2. ... that there was this great document about git? </H4>
See 2.1.

<H4> 2.3. ... that DVCS is the future, anything centralized is bad? </H4>
These are not facts, but slogens I don't believe in.

<H4> 2.4. ... what if someone has to develop offline for long? </H4>
In the 21th century, when we have cheap mobile internet even in eastern
europe?

<H4> 2.5. ... but feature X is harder with svn... </H4>
Almost all those features are bad for team work in my experience. They
are not even needed. Yes, some aspects of the development have to be
done differently without those - but this is good for the project.


<H3> 3. opengl </H3>

<H4> 3.1. But I need opengl! </H4>
Use the mainline then. Or contribute the code for sane opengl support
in pcb-rnd. I can live with a solution where opengl is a separate HID and
is not the default one. 

<H4> 3.2. ... good, then please make that opengl hid!</H4>
No, thanks. I don't need it, I wouldn't use it, there's no point in spending
my time on it. If you need it, I invite you to do it.

<H4> 3.3. Did you know that opengl can be turned off in mainline? </H4>
Yes. If I have a fork, I want its defaults to reflect my preferences.

<H4> 3.4. But transparent renders are so good on a board with many layers! </H4>
Not for me: transparency made even a 2 layer board cryptic when I tried. See
3.1.


<H3> 4. programming languages, file formats </H3>

<H4> 4.1. switch to C++, it is so much better </H4>
Nope. I prefer C.

<H4> 4.2. but pcb-rnd doesn't compile with a C++ compiled </H4>
Correct: pcb-rnd is written in C. It also doesn't compile with a pascal
compiler.

<H4> 4.3. but mainline already invested in preparing a C++ transition </H4>
Good for them. If I didn't have a fork, I'd fork the day when the first
C++ class is commited.

<H4> 4.4. we need sql for the file format </H4>
No, we don't. I prefer human readable text formats. No, converters won't
solve that. No, I don't care if python has support for loading sql files.

<H4> 4.3. we need to switch to xml/json (or python or perl arrays) </H4>
No, we don't need to.

<h4> 4.4. ... but they are easier to parse because of existing libs </h4>
Yup, but in any real life task that part of the parsing is like 5%. The
rest 95% needs to be programmed anyway. The costs of such a file format change
is not justified by this minor gain.

<h4> 4.5. ... but the current file format doesn't support feature X </h4>
True. And that's because the internal model (the in-core representation
and <b>all the code handling that</b>) doesn't support the feature either.
Changing the file format won't help that. It's similar to point 4.4.: 95%
of the effort is needed to get the code to support the feature, and by that
time the cost of getting it into the file format is neglible. Costs
are not justufied.

<H4> 4.6. ... but I can't build a database of the current lib </h4>
Too bad. Either figure how to do it, or just don't do it. pcb-rnd
offers scripting, even in languages that have sql support. In theory
it wouldn't be that hard to write scripts running in PCB manipulating
the buffer or even the in-core footpritns on one end and connecting
an sql database on the other end.
