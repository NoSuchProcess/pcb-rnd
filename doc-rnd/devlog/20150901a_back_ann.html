<H2> back annotation </H2>

<H3> Conclusions of the first thread </H3>
DJ has another <a href="http://www.delorie.com/pcb/pin-mapping.html"> model </a>
where back annotation is only a subset of a bigger mechanism.
<p>
Many other users commented the thread, but no one else presented a
plan that formed a <b>complete</b> system.
<p>
While there were some useful feedback about some details, no one explicitly
said he'd be contributing the gschem part (... for any of the ideas floating
around).
<p>
The thread is swamped in a chaotic set of random ideas and opinions - the
same way as previous related threads usually did.

<H3> Second thread </H3>
In the second thread I will focus on actual contribution. For this,
I'm narrowing down what exactly needs to be contributed:


<ul>
<li> 1. minor UI changes, most probably in the C part of the gschem code. 
somehow ending up in the official repo; I'd prefer to avoid maintaining a 
fork of gschem (no, having the fork in git doesn't help).

<li> 2. a scheme script that can be plugged into gschem and do real simple 
things like toggling flags for point 1, counting how many flags are 
toggled, warn the user about the counter is being non-zero; this script 
doesn't need to get into the official repo

<li> 3. depending on whether we (me and my actual contributor who contributes 
code) go for push or pull, we need: a new action or menu or whatever that 
can trigger a pull or some means that can collect a change list pushed and 
then indicate that something's happened. It's not really a third piece of 
code, just a third piece of concept that is spread across 1 and 2.
</ul>
<p>
First, I seek a contributor for exactly these 3 things. Alternatively if 
there's someone who is really willing to contribute actual code and spend 
time on this, I'm open to change parts of my plan if he has better ideas 
as long as the new approach still solves the actual problems I have.
