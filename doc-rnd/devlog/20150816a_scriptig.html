<h1> pcb-rnd devlog </h1>
<h2> scripting, 2 </h2>
I've been working on the documentation for pcb-rnd scripting lately. 
Proof reading and comments would be appreciated. The documents are 
work-in-progress.
<p>
I have a <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/pcb-rnd/gpmi/rosetta/index.html">Rosetta stone</a>
of examples demonstrating how to write simple scripts.
It doesn't explain how the system works, but shows easy-to-understand 
practical examples. Useful for those who like learn by doing and look up 
the "theoretical" background only after seeing things in practice.
<p>
Another document, the <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/pcb-rnd/gpmi/scripting_intro.html">
scripting intro</a> focuses on explaining how things are built up. This
one is useful for those who first want to understand the design  and then
look at how to do things in practice.
<p>
As a next step I plan to reorganize the package documentation and split 
them all into a high level "what's the concept" doc and a low level 
reference manual.
<p>
I also plan to improve the links between the docs and write more rosetta 
examples. I plan to have a few more all-language examples on the most 
basic things. The more complex examples would be written in awk, lua and 
maybe ruby.
