<h1> pcb-rnd - the [io_*]  patches </h1>

Mainline PCB core was coupled with the file format; the [io] patch set is
an effort to decouple any file design I/O from core. The original file format
(plain text .pcb and .fp) lives on as plugin called io_pcb.

<p>
TODO

<h2> save/load and compatibility </h2>
Not affected when io_pcb is used and .pcb or .fp files are loaded or saved.
<p>
Using other io_* implementations will obviously result in files that are
incompatible with mainline pcb (unless mainline pcb learns how to load those
formats).

<h2> plans </h2>
The project is still in an early phase.
