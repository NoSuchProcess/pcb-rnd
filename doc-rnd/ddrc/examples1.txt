# Example 1: Sensitive RF elements should be close
#
# e1 is the list of elements that have the user tag RF
# e2 is a copy of e1; it's needed to get two loops (e1 vs. e2 objects form pairs)
# Assert that any two components are closer than 25 mm to each other

rule sensitive RF elements
	let e1 (@.p.type == type(element)) && (@.a.group == "RF")
	let e2 e1
	assert (distance(e1, e2) < 25 mm)

# Example 2: matched trace lengths on dram data 0
#
# e1 is the list of dram traces
# e2 is a copy of e1 (see Example 1)
# Assert that any two net lengths are matched within 2 mm

rule sensitive RF elements
	let e1 (@.p.type == type(net)) && (@.a.group == "dram_data_0")
	let e2 e1
	assert abs(netlen(e1) - netlen(e2)) < 2 mm

# Example 3: check if isolation gap is maintained between any HV and LV nets
# (Lazy: assume any copper is part of a network, compare net-to-net only)
#
# hv  is the list of high voltage nets
# lv  is a list of non-hv networks
#
rule sensitive RF elements1
	let hv  (@.p.type == type(net)) && (@.a.high_voltage)
	let lv  (@.p.type == type(net)) && !(@.a.high_voltage)
	assert !is_closer(lv, hv, 4 mm) 

# Example 4: check if isolation gap is maintained between any HV and LV nets
# (Proper way: do not forget about copper not part of any network!)
#
# hv  is the list of high voltage nets
# hvo is a list of all objects found in hv
# cp  is a list of all copper object
# There are two iterators in the assert: cp (all copper objects) and hv.
# For each hv and cp pair:
#   - lcomplement returns a cp object if the cp object is not in hv (i.e.
#     the object is low voltage); else the return value is empty and is_closer
#     returns invalid which is not a violation
#   - hvo is required because cp is an object while hv is a list of nets
#     (so cp is never on the hv list)
#   - if there was a valid (low voltage) cp object found, 
rule sensitive RF elements2
	let hv  (@.p.type == type(net)) && (@.a.high_voltage)
	let hvo lobjs(hv)
	let cp  (@.p.type == type(copper))
