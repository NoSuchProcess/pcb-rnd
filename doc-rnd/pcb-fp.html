<h1> pcb-rnd - the [pcb-fp] patch </h1>

Pcb-fp is an effort to clean up the footprint situation:
<ul>
	<li> replace lib and newlib with pcblib, a library that tries to provide common footprints only
	<li> clear the syntax: if a footprint name contains parenthesis, it's generated (parametric footprint), else it's the name of a static footprint file
	<li> parametric footprints: replace m4 with a generic, language-independent footprint generator framework
	<ul>
		<li> implement libpcb_fp, which centralizes searching and loading footprints
		<li> fork gsch2pcb to gsch2pcb-rnd that uses libpcb_fp (and does not have any m4 references hardwired)
		<li> fork gnet_gsch2pcb.scm (the gnetlist backend) to remove m4 heuristics
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3> Example </h3>
Intaractive parametric footprint selection in pcb-rnd:

An <a href="http://igor2.repo.hu/cgi-bin/pcblib-param.cgi"> online footprint generator web1.0 version</a> is also available.

<h2> save/load and compatibility </h2>
Save/load files are not affected. If a schematics is written for the new
library and depends on parametric footprints:
<ul>
	<li> mainline gsch2pcb won't find those footprints
	<li> mainline pcb won't show those footprints in the footprint selection dialog
</ul>

<h2> plans </h2>
No plans - this feature is fully implemented.
