<h1> pcb-rnd - the [cycdrag]  patches </h1>

A long standing misfeature of pcb (and pcb-rnd) has been that when dragging the
end of connected traces, pcb chosen one of the traces "randomly". It often
didn't pick the one the user wanted to move. The workaround was to move the
one that pcb picked and then return and move the target trace then
move the other trace back. This gets even more annoying if there are more than
two objects connected in the given point: 3 traces and a via for example.
<p>
The cycdrag patch addresses this issue by defining an action that can cycle
through objects that could be dragged in the given point while the left mouse
button is pressed. This lets the user explicitly select the one object to
work on.
<p>
This <a href="https://archive.org/details/pcb-rnd-cycdrag"> demo video </a>
demonstrates how it works with three lines and a via.
