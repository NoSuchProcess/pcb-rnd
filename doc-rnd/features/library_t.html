<h1> pcb-rnd - the [library_t] patch </h1>

The original code has a special setup for representing trees, C structures
called LibraryMenu and LibraryEntry. This system can represent only a subset
of trees: there is a root, a level consist of directories only and a next level,
each directory consist of data nodes only. This has been enough for newlib,
which strictly follows this model in the file system hierarchy. The lesstif
HID also hardwired this model in the GUI.
<p>
In pcb-rnd this has been replaced with a new struct type called library_t
that can represent an arbitrary tree: directories and files within directories
down to many levels.
<p>
Both the gtk and the lesstif had has been modified accordingly and can
properly display the tree. This in turn enables alternative footprint backend
implementations such as <a href="fp_wget.html"> fp_wget <a> to import
more complex libraries, e.g. the one on gedasymbols.org.
