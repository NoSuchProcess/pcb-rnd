<h1> pcb-rnd - the [pcblib] and [pcblib-param] and [fp_fs] patches </h1>
<table border=0>
<tr><td valign=top>
The footprint library shipped with mainline pcb is cluttered with
special puprose parts. I believe PCB encourages the user from
an early stage to build his own library. Thus the purpose of
the library shipped with PCB should be
to provide a minimal collection of real essential footprints ...
<ul>
	<li> ... for the very beginning of the learning curve;
	<li> ... and to be the core of the user's own library later.
</ul>
<p>
[pcblib] is a replacement of newlib/ and lib/ and the m4 macros with
such an essential core library of static footprints ("file elements")
and easier-to-use parametric footprints.
<p>
There is an <a href="http://igor2.repo.hu/tmp/pcblib"> online map</a> of
the library and <a href="http://igor2.repo.hu/cgi-bin/pcblib-param.cgi">
an online interface to the parametric footprint generators. </a>

<h2> Design decisions </h2>
Parts are sorted only in a few directories: smd, tru-hole, connector and
parametric. I believe there are so many orthogonal properties of footpritns
that there's no obvious hierarchy. Also, pcblib contains much fewer footpritns
than newlib so it should be still easy to navigate.
<p>
Parametric footprints are in a separate directory for now, even tho they
would fit under smd, tru-hole or connector. The reason is purely historical
and the layout may change in the future.

<h2> Example </h2>
To the right: Footprint selection dialog on pcblib, with the smd directory
open. Note how few smd parts are there. Still, smd/ is the most crowded
subdirectory!

<h2> [fp_fs] </h2>
As of vesion 1.0.10, the footprint list/search/load of footprints is a plugin.
The original code that handles local file system footprint libraries (e.g.
pcblib or newlib) is now a plugin. Altnerative plugins can be provided that work
from databases or <a href="fp_wget.html"> from the web</a>. In extreme
situations the file system based footprint plugin can even be disabled.

<h2> save/load and compatibility </h2>
Not affected: elements are embedded in the PCB.

<h2> plans </h2>
None, the feature is complete.
