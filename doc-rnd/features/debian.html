<h1> pcb-rnd - the [debian] patch </h1>

The name of the package has been changed to pcb-rnd; a conflict with the
mainline pcb is set.
<p>
The lesstif variant and pcb documentation are not compiled or packaged
- I don't need them. The possibility is still there to compile them, tho.
<p>
The gtk variant (pcb-rnd-gtk) has both dbus and gl disabled.
<p>
Versioning scheme changed to match svn revisions and tags of pcb-rnd.

<h2> plans </h2>
No plans - this feature is fully implemented.
