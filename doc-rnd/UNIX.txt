State on UNIX systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source releases starting from 1.1.2 should compile and run out-of-the-box
on old UNIX systems, such as IRIX. Does NOT require any GNU installed.

Requirements:
  - x11 and motif (for the GUI)
  - an awk implementation that supports gsub(), e.g. nawk

1. If your C compiler does not support #warning, run a script to patch
   the source:

     # cwd is the root of the distribution
     util/workarounds/unwarn_all.sh

   This will take a while and will modify a lot of .c files.

2. ./configure

3. make

Considerations listed in ../INSTALL apply.

The above procedure has been tested on IRIX 5.3 on IP22.

Expected compilation times [minute:second]:

./configure       compile, -O0     compile -O3   system
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1:55              7:40             14:27         IRIX 5.3, IP22 @ 100 MHz
