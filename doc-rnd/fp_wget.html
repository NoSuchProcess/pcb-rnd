<h1> pcb-rnd - the [fp_wget] patch </h1>

Since version 1.0.10, pcb-rnd implements a new footprint mechanism (see
<a href="pcblib.html">[fp_fs]</a> and <a href="library_t.html">[library_t]</a>).
The new code allows footprint backend plugins to get library from anywhere.
The [fp_wget] plugin is an implementation that:
<ul>
	<li> downloads a library list from the web on startup into a local cache
	<li> downloads footprints from the web on-demand into a local cache
</ul>
<p>
This is all transparent, the user experience is that the remote library is
like a read-only local library reachable from the library window. 
<p>
A web site used as a library should be able to:
<ul>
	<li> generate a plain text list of all footprints available
	<li> return the raw footprint file by name
</ul>
<p>
The plugin uses external program <i>wget</i> to communicate on the web.
