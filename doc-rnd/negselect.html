<h1> pcb-rnd - the [cycdrag] patches, negative box select </h1>

When a selection is made using drag&drop (box selection), depending
on the direction the rule for object selection differ:
<ul>
	<li> drag from top-right towards bottom-left (positive sized box):
	     select objects that are fully contained in the box (original behaviour)
	<li> drag from bottom-left towards top-right (negative sized box):
	     select objects that are even partially within the box or merely touch
	     the edge of the box
</ul>

<h2> save/load and compatibility </h2>
Not affected.

<h2> plans </h2>
Work more on some rough corners of the negative direction: e.g. pads are
handled as 0 width lines so the selection has to hit the center.
