<h1> pcb-rnd - how to get my favorite feature implemented </h1>

The list below is sorted: top items have higher priority, but you
are free to choose any.

<H3> 1. If you are a programmer with free time to spend </H3>
Read the <a href="contrib.html"> contribution howto</a> and join the project.
You are welcome to work only on the feature you are interested in. You get
all the support (e.g. for understending the API, to get a blank plugin
set up so you need to fill in only the feature-specific parts, etc.). Success
rate shoudl be near to 100%.

<H3> 2. If you are not a programmer and have free time </H3>
You can join and work on things you don't need that much, but others do. 
This will build your reputation in the community which in turns encourages
others to implement your favorite feature even if they wouldn't do it for
themselves. The success rate is somewhat more random, obviously.

<H3> 3. If you don't have free time </H3>
Consider donation: buy someone else's time. To do so, contact me
(see the <a href="contrib.html"> contribution howto</a> page). Since
you don't need to cover all costs and the hourly rates are much lower
on a pet project, and your feature may be simpler than it looks, and
someone who already knows the code also saves thelearning cureve, it may
all be cheaper than you think. The success rate should be close to 100%.
<p>
However, this is a last resort solution, the above ones are clearly preferred.


<H3> 4. If you don't have anything to contribute with </H3>
[DEL:Vote for it in the <a href="http://igor2.repo.hu/cgi-bin/pcb-rnd-poll.cgi">
feature poll</a>. If your feature is not there, ask on the mailing list.
Chance for success: if it's a popular demand on the feature poll, chances
are somewhat good. Else chances are very low, but not zero.:DEL]
<p>
Because of 100% passivity of the geda community, I decided not to spend more
time on community-related tasks. The poll is there, you can use it,
but you will have to orgnaize at least 5 active, capable users who are
commited enough to spend significant time on testing/supporting development.
I will consider implementing your feature only if you can bring and keep
those people motivated and active.

<H3> 5. If you tried everything, even point 4. and all failed... </H3>
Complain loudly on the mailing list, advertise your opinion, try pushing
the thing - a.k.a. go trolling. <b>Success rate is exactly 0%</b>,
you make a lot of good <del>friends</del> enemies that will make it harder
to ask or contribute later for another feature, but it may make you feel
better. &lt;/irony&gt;.
