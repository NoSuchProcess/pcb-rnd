<H1> The new config system in pcb-rnd </H1>
<H2> Config file syntax </H2>

The config file sytnax is <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/lihata">lihata</a>.
Most users don't need to understand most of the syntax, just follow the
patterns seen in the examples. A few thumb of rules:
<ul>
	<li> srtuctural nodes usually start with a ha: or li: prefix; which one needs to be used is pretty much tied to the node name; thus casual users don't need to care about what they are for, just remember them as part of the name
	<li> non-structural nodes are usually given in the form of name = value; use braces around the value if it contains any non-alphanumeric, non-whitespace character
	<li> list and array members should better be braced
	<li> list and array separator should be semicolon (not comma)
</ul>

<H3> config root syntax </H3>
<p>
A pcb-rnd config file, (or <i>document</i> for short) has a single root
node whose name must be li:pcb-rnd-conf-v1 - this is the signature of the
document. It is a flat list of one or more <i>config root/</i> subtrees.
TODO: is this really a list or a hash?
<p>
Each config root is a partial description of the
<a href=index_user.html"> config tree </a> (which is the logical
confgiuration of all possible settings). Config roots have a policy and
a <a href="prio.html">priority</a> attached. This is done in the name
of the config root, which must be of the form of <i>policy-priority</i>,
e.g. "overwrite-300" or "append-125". The priority part (with the dash)
can be omitted (and then the per role default priority is used), e.g.
"overwrite" or "append" are valid config root names.
<p>
Under the config root, a tree of sections (hashes) and setting values
(text nodes) are built. These structures and values are in 1:1 
correspondance with <a href="groups.html">the config tree</a>. Excess
(unknown) keys are considered a warning (except in the plugin/ and
utils/ subtrees). Missing keys or missing subtrees is normal because a config
root can be partial.
