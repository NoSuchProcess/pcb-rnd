<H1> The new config system in pcb-rnd </H1>
<H2> Lists and arrays </H2>

Non-scalar settings are arrays or lists. Arrays can be explicitly indexed

The default <i>policy</i> is always <i>overwrite</i>.
<p>
There are three active policies: <i>overwrite</i>, <i>prepend</i> and <i>append</i>.
When dealing with lists:
<ul>
	<li> step 1: the output list is reset to empty
	<li> step 2: all sources that describe the list are sorted by priority 
	<li> step 3: sources are applied in order
</ul>
Step 3 is straight-forward: if policy is <i>overwrite</i>, reset the output
list and copy the source's list into the output list. If policy is
<i>prepend</i> (or <i>append</i>), keep the current output list and prepend
(or append) the list provided  by the source. 
<p>
In practice this means the user can replace, prepend or append ordered lists
from various sources. A common example is setting the library search paths.
