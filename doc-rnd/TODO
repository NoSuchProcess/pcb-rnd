- distorted square pin bugs:
	- rtree assert failure when NDEBUG is turned off
	- there's larger clearance with shaped pins on the enlarged sides
	- why q doesn't work on vias (new comment about this in action.c)
	- r tree breaks!!!
	- rotate should rotate pin shape as well
- merge pcb-gpmi in pcb-rnd
- scconfig:
	- switch over from automake:
		- example/
		- w32/
	- clean up central Makefile.in rules:
		- remove cat, sed, grep where possible, use scconfig instead
	- when gpcb menu res is empty, pcb segfaults on startup
- drill adjust:
	- set drill and/or ring to current style
	- set all pins (drill and/or ring) to current style for a component
- clear poly should be a per layer flag
- zero width copper lines to split polys
- be able to manually change text line width

Low prio:
- decide what to do with old doc - texi doesn't seem to work at all
- rethink/rewrite the action/change infrastructure - too many void *ptr1
  pointers, too many code duplication
- double sided board, poly on both layers; grab existing lines on one layer and
  move then around. If all layers are visible, redraw of the far side layer
  is slow and causes flickering elements from that layer until the front is
  redrawn. Maybe we should have less flushes?
