- scconfig:
		- example/

BUGS
- distorted square pin bugs:
	- rtree assert failure when NDEBUG is turned off and 'q' is pressed on a pin twice
	- there's larger clearance with shaped pins on the enlarged sides

FEATURES
- merge pcb-gpmi in pcb-rnd {large}
- win32 port {large}
	- clean up central Makefile.in rules:
		- remove cat, sed, grep where possible, use scconfig instead
- UI: drill adjust: {small}
	- set drill and/or ring to current style
	- set all pins (drill and/or ring) to current style for a component
- UI: trace length calculation {small}
- UI: be able to manually change text line width {small}
- UI: component filter by tags
- CORE: clear poly should be a per layer flag (on each objects) {?}
- CORE: inverse text {medium}
- BUILD: menuconfig and a config file for scconfig


Low prio:
- decide what to do with old doc - texi doesn't seem to work at all
- rethink/rewrite the action/change infrastructure - too many void *ptr1
  pointers, too many code duplication
- double sided board, poly on both layers; grab existing lines on one layer and
  move then around. If all layers are visible, redraw of the far side layer
  is slow and causes flickering elements from that layer until the front is
  redrawn. Maybe we should have less flushes?
