- BUGS
	- place text, edit -> assert (used to work because of NDEBUG?)
	- arc bug: draw an arc with one end out of the drawing area; it will be jumpy and can not be placed properly
	- the TAB bug: (over ssh -X) press tab for a good 15 seconds; release; it won't work again for a fraction of a second
	- bg image png crashes in extreme pan
	- netlist window open with no netlist -> CRASH

- replace settings with lihata (conf_*)
	- remove CFN_INCREMENTS, test if saving increments from preferences works
	- TEST:
		- atexit change -> is the design saved periodically? is it saved on a crash?
		- project files:
			- save only if changed, when the project is saved
			- save project conf properly (needs lihata smart save long term, test with plain save now)
		- vendor drill mapping
		- djopt, auto_only flag
		- gsch2pcb
		- CFR_DESIGN; check changing:
			- layer groups
			- pcb size
		- ps export vs. thin draw poly, check_planes
		- png and gerber export vs. forced sets
		- test lesstif
		- test with all plugins enabled (maybe add an scconfig cli arg for this?)
		- fontmode
		- change style in both GUIs
		- what are these and how to test them:
			{"showmask", FlagTESTFLAG, SHOWMASKFLAG}
			{"fullpoly", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.full_poly)}
			{"savelastcommand", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.save_last_command)}
			{"saveintmp", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.save_in_tmp)}
			{"ratwarn", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, temp.rat_warn)}
			{"stipplepolygons", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.stipple_polygons)}
					{"showdrcmode", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.show_drc)}
			{"resetafterelement", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.reset_after_element)}
			{"ringbellwhenfinished", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.beep_when_finished)}
		- import schematics:
			- gnetlist_program, make_program from conf
			- gnetlist_program, make_program from env var
		- gtk, preferences dialog, user pov
		- test if all plugins work from .so
		- test clearance + drc clearance
		- route style in gtk and lesstif, save, load, 0, 1 or a lot of styles
		- route style vs. autorouter

CLEANUP #5
- scconfig:
	- revise the bison/flex rule templates; rather use bison/flex output name
	  feature instead of the mkdir hack.
- gtk: grep for "TODO msg": store messages while the hid is not active but is already called
- conf:
	- debug why default layer names from the user config are ignored
	- fp_fs_search: kill anything that gets ':' separated string as path list, get a config list instead
	- switch the lesstif HID over from attribs to conf
	- remove redundancy: don't store values in the PCB struct that are in the design conf
	- increments are not really implemented
	- if font file is not found:
		- embedded version?
		- warn when try to write text on pcb?
	- finish gtk hid preferences config pov
- action bug: gui_act.c shouldn't reference Crosshair.X directly; check d-fix.patch about how to fix it
- scconfig: check for bison/flex, do not regenerate languages if they are missing
- next_gui: keep them open, hide
- look for #warnings
- fix librarychanged: disable update of gedasymbols on-start, make it an explicit refresh button
- libstroke: zoom
- cleanup/rewrite resources:
	- load/swap menus (TODO#1)
	- gpmi:
		- hid: hid_destroy (pair of hid_create)
		- cleanup on unload: remove menus
- check whether local copy of gts is needed, bisect when toporouter broke 
- check gpmi when pcb-rnd is fully linstalled - broken symlinks?
- multi-key: display state on the gui
- Message() should have a first param that tells if it is an error, info, etc.; pop up window on error, red
- TODO#3: works only on US keyboard
- gsch2pcb: generalize plugin/buildin loading for external tools, check if gsch2pcb can work from plugins

CLEANUP #6:
- res:
	- search for vendor in the hid plugins, there should be no trace of it (vendor should register its in submenus with anchors)
	- re-add dynamic menus after a gui change:
		- either remember dynamic menus in a separate list so they can be rebuilt
		- or provide hooks and let plugins deal with it
	- gpmi: auto-remove menus by cookie (TODO#2)
	- load new res on the fly (replace the menu system):
		- low level reload code (re-add the dynamic menus too!)
		- action to reload if file name is known
		- gui load dialog with tags listed

- reduce
		- centralize all keyeq() calls
		- hash in hid_attrib.c?
		- hash in hid_color.c; test: eps
		- nelma and gcode both invent .png name locally
		- get rid of gcode/lists.h,  and vector.[ch] (autorouter)
		- revise RCSID and $id$
		- vendordrill
			- search for /units, replace it with pcb-printf something
			- add round down
			- replace ignore_refdes, ignore_value and ignore_descr with genvector
	- mods:
		- gpmi (and other buildins/plugins) not showing up in the about box
- self contained
	- files
		- default font
	- action (--show-paths!) and dialog box to print where the actual files are coming from
	- project specific menus from extra lihata files - maybe from project.lht
- main.c:
	- SIGPIPE - do we need it? probably yes, because we can run commands

FEATURES
- BUILD: menuconfig and a config file for scconfig
- dynstyle: remove existing style (gtk hid, maybe key 'del'?)

Low prio:
- display net names on pins, vias (and maybe tracks?) when zoomed in enough
- DRC should warn for thin poly hair
- rotate shaped vias don't rotate the shape (is via rotated at all?)
- new examples
	- blinking led with parametric footprints
	- example of nonetlist: 1206 jumpers and logos
- decide what to do with old doc - texi doesn't seem to work at all
- rethink/rewrite the action/change infrastructure - too many void *ptr1
  pointers, too many code duplication
- double sided board, poly on both layers; grab existing lines on one layer and
  move then around. If all layers are visible, redraw of the far side layer
  is slow and causes flickering elements from that layer until the front is
  redrawn. Maybe we should have less flushes?
- gpmi:
	- dialog: attribute dialog: mini parser from text
	- fix debug draw in the gtk hid
	- ACTE_action(): coords should not be int but Coord
	- get timers to work
- win32 port {large}
	- clean up central Makefile.in rules:
		- remove cat, sed, grep where possible, use scconfig instead
