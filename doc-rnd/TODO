- distorted square pin bugs:
	- rtree assert failure when NDEBUG is turned off
	- large clearance with octagon
	- why q doesn't work on vias (new comment about this in action.c)
	- r tree breaks!!!
- 1206 jumpers:
	- gsch2pcb patch
- merge pcb-gpmi in pcb-rnd
- rethink/rewrite the action/change infrastructure - too many void *ptr1
  pointers, too many code duplication
- scconfig:
	- switch over from automake:
		- doc/
		- example/
		- lib/
		- newlib/
		- w32/
	- clean up central Makefile.in rules:
		- remove cat, sed, grep where possible, use scconfig instead
	- when gpcb menu res is empty, pcb segfaults on startup
- drill adjust:
	- set drill and/or ring to current style
	- set all pins (drill and/or ring) to current style for a component
- clear poly should be a per layer flag
- zero width copper lines to split polys
- be able to manually change text line width
