BUGS
- distorted square pin bugs:
	- rtree assert failure when NDEBUG is turned off and 'q' is pressed on a pin twice

CLEANUP
	- remove libstroke?

FEATURES
- merge pcb-gpmi in pcb-rnd {large}
	- action: call an existing action
	- dialog: check and document if hid package can create these (+mini parser from text?)
	- hid: hid_destroy (pair of hid_create)
	- layout: more functions to list layers, id->layername function
- UI: drill adjust: {small}
	- set drill and/or ring to current style
	- set all pins (drill and/or ring) to current style for a component
- UI: component filter by tags

- UI: trace length calculation {small}
- win32 port {large}
	- clean up central Makefile.in rules:
		- remove cat, sed, grep where possible, use scconfig instead
- UI: be able to manually change text line width {small}
- CORE: clear poly should be a per layer flag (on each objects) {?}
- CORE: inverse text {medium}
- BUILD: menuconfig and a config file for scconfig


Low prio:
- rotate shaped vias don't rotate the shape (is via rotated at all?)
- new examples
	- blinking led with parametric footprints
	- example of nonetlist: 1206 jumpers and logos
- decide what to do with old doc - texi doesn't seem to work at all
- rethink/rewrite the action/change infrastructure - too many void *ptr1
  pointers, too many code duplication
- double sided board, poly on both layers; grab existing lines on one layer and
  move then around. If all layers are visible, redraw of the far side layer
  is slow and causes flickering elements from that layer until the front is
  redrawn. Maybe we should have less flushes?
- cleanup resources:
	- better tree structs with less hidden properties (minor change in the res format: always require key=val pairs)
	- gtk, lesstif: reorganize the code so that:
		- menus are always created using a path (ghid_main_menu_real_add_resource)
		- res->menu should be a common code
- check whether local copy of gts is needed
- move genht out of pcb-mincut
