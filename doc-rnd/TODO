BUGS:
	- arc bug: draw an arc with one end out of the drawing area; it will be jumpy and can not be placed properly
	- the TAB bug: (over ssh -X) press tab for a good 15 seconds; release; it won't work again for a fraction of a second

- replace settings with lihata (conf_*)
	- menu lht updates:
		- fix lesstif menu lht for conf(toggle, editor/draw_grid, design)
		- pcb-menu-mkey.lht
	- remove redundancy: don't store values in the PCB struct that are in the design conf
	- CLI: check if it still works
		- -auto-place -> conf_core.editor.auto_place
	- optimize conf-update-after-set:
		- we know whether the node we change ended up in native (check prop.src)
		- recalc native directly if did so - never run conf_update!
		- revise each call to conf_update(), especially from the set macros!
	- add CFR_DESIGN
		- assign some high prio
		- check changing:
			- layer groups
			- pcb size
	- increments are not really implemented
	- shouldn't segfault if pcb-conf.lht is missing (embedded version?)
	- replace hid_load_settings() with lihata
	- plugin unload should unregister binary conf items
		- mincut
	- revise main.c, line by line
	- setting prio (top pri to bottom prio):
			cli/action/manual override
			vendor
			design
			project
			user
			system
			hardwired
	- TEST:
		- ps export vs. thin draw poly, check_planes
		- png and gerber export vs. forced sets
		- test lesstif
		- test with all plugins enabled (maybe add an scconfig cli arg for this?)
		- fontmode
		- change style in both GUIs
		- what are these and how to test them:
			{"showmask", FlagTESTFLAG, SHOWMASKFLAG}
			{"fullpoly", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.full_poly)}
			{"savelastcommand", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.save_last_command)}
			{"saveintmp", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.save_in_tmp)}
			{"ratwarn", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, temp.rat_warn)}
			{"stipplepolygons", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.stipple_polygons)}
					{"showdrcmode", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.show_drc)}
			{"resetafterelement", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.reset_after_element)}
			{"ringbellwhenfinished", FlagSETTINGS, OffsetOf(conf_core_t, editor.beep_when_finished)}

CLEANUP #5
- shift key bug
- release zoom on menu lockup
- action bug: gui_act.c shouldn't reference Crosshair.X directly; check d-fix.patch about how to fix it
- scconfig: check for bison/flex, do not regenerate languages if they are missing
- next_gui: keep them open, hide
- look for #warnings
- fix librarychanged: disable update of gedasymbols on-start, make it an explicit refresh button
- move print.[ch]
- BUG: don't use ~/.pcb, use ~/.pcb-rnd; do not hardwire this in the code, make it a config.h setting
- libstroke: zoom
- cleanup/rewrite resources:
	- load/swap menus (TODO#1)
	- gpmi:
		- hid: hid_destroy (pair of hid_create)
		- cleanup on unload: remove menus
- check whether local copy of gts is needed, bisect when toporouter broke 
- check gpmi when pcb-rnd is fully linstalled - broken symlinks?
- multi-key: display state on the gui
- Message() should have a first param that tells if it is an error, info, etc.; pop up window on error, red
- TODO#3: works only on US keyboard
- gsch2pcb: generalize plugin/buildin loading for external tools, check if gsch2pcb can work from plugins

CLEANUP #6:
- res:
	- search for vendor in the hid plugins, there should be no trace of it (vendor should register its in submenus with anchors)
	- re-add dynamic menus after a gui change:
		- either remember dynamic menus in a separate list so they can be rebuilt
		- or provide hooks and let plugins deal with it
	- gpmi: auto-remove menus by cookie (TODO#2)
	- load new res on the fly:
		- low level reload code (re-add the dynamic menus too!)
		- action to reload if file name is known
		- gui load dialog with tags listed

- reduce
		- centralize all keyeq() calls
		- hash in hid_attrib.c?
		- hash in hid_color.c; test: eps
		- nelma and gcode both invent .png name locally
		- get rid of gcode/lists.h,  and vector.[ch] (autorouter)
		- revise RCSID and $id$
		- vendordrill
			- search for /units, replace it with pcb-printf something
			- add round down
			- replace ignore_refdes, ignore_value and ignore_descr with genvector
	- mods:
		- gpmi (and other buildins/plugins) not showing up in the about box
- self contained
	- files
		- menu_lht
		- default font
	- action and dialog box to print where the actual files are coming from
	- project specific menus from extra lihata files



FEATURES
- UI: trace length calculation {small}
- UI: be able to manually change text line width {small}
- CORE: clear poly should be a per layer flag (on each objects) {?}
- CORE: inverse text {medium}
- BUILD: menuconfig and a config file for scconfig
- split line segment into two (insert line point in the middle)

Low prio:
- display net names on pins, vias (and maybe tracks?) when zoomed in enough
- DRC should warn for thin poly hair
- prev grid size, next grid size
- rotate shaped vias don't rotate the shape (is via rotated at all?)
- new examples
	- blinking led with parametric footprints
	- example of nonetlist: 1206 jumpers and logos
- decide what to do with old doc - texi doesn't seem to work at all
- rethink/rewrite the action/change infrastructure - too many void *ptr1
  pointers, too many code duplication
- double sided board, poly on both layers; grab existing lines on one layer and
  move then around. If all layers are visible, redraw of the far side layer
  is slow and causes flickering elements from that layer until the front is
  redrawn. Maybe we should have less flushes?
- gpmi:
	- dialog: attribute dialog: mini parser from text
	- fix debug draw in the gtk hid
	- ACTE_action(): coords should not be int but Coord
	- get timers to work
- win32 port {large}
	- clean up central Makefile.in rules:
		- remove cat, sed, grep where possible, use scconfig instead
