State on MacOSX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Should compile and run out-of-the-box.

Requirements:  x11 and gtk+
  - X11 server and client libraries for OS X are available from the XQuartz 
     download and install
  - gtk+ is available from brew
     * brew install gtk+

Known issues:
  - application window opens behind other windows; it seems to be a gtk bug
    that can not be worked around from the application
  - element sometimes duplicated on move
  - slow rendering and error messages about invalid numerics on the console
