State on MacOSX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Should compile and run out-of-the-box.

Known issues:
  - application window opens behind other windows; it seems to be a gtk bug
    that can not be worked around from the application
  - element sometimes duplicated on move
  - slow rendering and error messages about invalid numerics on the console
