<h1> pcb-rnd - the [flagcomp] patch </h1>

Many of the patches in this fork, and in possible future branches/forks
may introduce new pin, pad or element flags. PCB loads and saves flags
by converting the text representation to an in-memory binary format. Any
flag not understood is lost.
<p>
This patch adds a linked list of string flags, filled in with the unknown
flags while loading a PCB. On save, these flags are appended to the normal
flag list. This preserves all unknown flags (but not order of flags) in
a load/save cycle.

<h2> save/load and compatibility </h2>
This patch ensures compatibility in save/load cycles with flags introduced
by later versions of vanilla PCB or different branches/forks of PCB by
not removing flags they introduced.

<h2> plans </h2>
No plans - this feature is fully implemented.
