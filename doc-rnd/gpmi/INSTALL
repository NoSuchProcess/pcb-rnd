Compilation and installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<TODO>
	8. run pcb; functionality provided by scripts should be accessible. With the
	   test script:
		- new exporters should show up in the export list
		- :gpmi command 

Installing new plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	1. download the plugin script
	2. if they are not installed yet, install the script interpreter and the
	   gpmi module for that interpreter, depending on what language the script
	   is written in <TODO>
	3. edit one of the pcb-gpmi.conf files you have in PCB's plugin search path

Plugin search path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The safest place for plugins is ~/.pcb/plugins, however installing plugins
or scripts in this directory will allow use of those plugins or scripts
only for the given user. For system installation accessible paths may
depend on PCB configuration. They are usually the following directories:
	/usr/lib/pcb/plugins
	/usr/lib/pcb/plugins/i386

Of course i386 may be anything else depending on your system and /usr/ may
be /usr/local/ or anything else if prefix was set during configuration of
PCB.

Furthermore the current working directory is checked for the config file
as well to allow project to have project-specific plugin scripts.

When loading scripts, paths are relative to the config file's directory or
absolute if starting with /. If script path starts with ~/, it is substituted
with the user's home directory (got from $HOME).

Note: if there are more than one config file are found, all of them are
loaded.
