<H1> pcb-rnd scripting - Rosetta </H1>
The <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>
of pcb-rnd scripting</i> is a collection of example scripts implemented in
various scripting languages. Rosetta has two purposes: to provide examples
of using the pcb-rnd API and to help the user to decide which language to use
for a specific task.
<p>
Each example comes with an explanation, written in plain English about what the
scripts do, step by step. Instead of trying to exploit powerful features
of the language, example implementations try to be simple.
<p>
The list below is ordered from the least complex to the most complex examples.
Column <i>lvl</i> is the complexity score. The less the score is, the simpler
the example is.
