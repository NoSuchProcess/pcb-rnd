PCB features that would make this plugin system simpler
	1. custom menus
		The gui should have a menu somehwere and list all tool hids just
		like it lists all exporters. As there would be much more tools than
		exporters, it may make sense to use a tree structure instead of a
		simple list.
	
	2. some compile-time settings should be exported from PCB:
	    EXECPREFIXDIR
	    HOST
	    MAX_LAYER
