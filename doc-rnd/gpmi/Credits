Big thanks to DJ Delorie who added external HID support in PCB and commited
many small patches needed to get this project working in the period
when the whole project was a plugin to vanilla pcb.

The following people helped the project with their valuable feedbacks
in the early stage:
 John Griessen
 Carlos Nieves Onega
