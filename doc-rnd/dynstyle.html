<h1> pcb-rnd - the [dynstyle] patch </h1>

Pcb-rnd doesn't have a hardwired limit on number of routing styles
anymore. Routing styles can be created on the fly and are saved to and loaded
from .pcb files.
<p>
There's no theoretical maximum explicitly set either. An implicit maximum
exists and is sizeof(int) - should be at least 2^31 on most systems.

<h2> save/load and compatibility </h2>
The first 4 styles are loaded and preserved by mainline. Styles above
4 would probably be deleted in a mainline load-save cycle. The number 4
is a constant value that can be changed if mainline is recompiled.

<h2> plans </h2>
GUI HID representation of styles (especially in menus) need more testing.
