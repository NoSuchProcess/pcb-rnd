<h1> Installation of the footprint CGIs </h1>
<h2> system requirements, 3rd party software </h2>
	The following software needs to be installed on the system
	that will host the scripts:
	<ul>
		<li> /bin/bash (did not test with POSIX shell)
		<li> awk (tested with gawk, may work with other modern implementation)
		<li> common binutils, e.g. ls, find
		<li> <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/animator">animator</a>, the svn HEAD version; NOTE: it is possible to manually compile animator into a static executable (useful on dedicated web servers)
		<li> a web server that can execute plain old CGI scripts
		<li> a full checkout of pcb-rnd/trunk from svn://repo.hu/pcb-rnd/trunk
	</ul>

<h2> Installation </h2>
Since the CGIs are just demo scripts for repo.hu and are not really installed
anywhere else normally, there is no install script but a manual installation
process. For both the parametric and the static footprint CGI:
<ol>
	<li> check out pcb-rnd/trunk in a directory readable (but not writable) by www-data (or whatever user the CGI will run with)
	<li> copy the config file pcblib.cgi.conf from pcb-rnd/trunk/util to /etc
	<li> edit the config file; ignore setting sdir for now
	<li> hardlink, copy, or wrap the cgi files from under pcb-rnd/trunk/util into the web server's CGI directory
</ol>
<p>
For the static footprint CGI (set up the map cache):
<ol>
	<li> cd to trunk/util/pcblib-map in the checkout and run make - NOTE: some awk scripts have hardwired CGI paths yet (TODO)
	<li> copy this directory to a web-accessible directory
	<li> set sdir to the absolute path of the web-accessible copy in /etc/pcblib.cgi.conf
</ol>

<h2> Tips and tricks </h2>
<h3> cgi wrapping </h3>
Making the checkout directly into the cgi-bin dir is not a good idea. Using
a hard link on each CGI between the checkout and the cgi-bin dir is better,
but an svn up will silently break the link leaving the old version live.
The most stable solution is placing a wrapper script in the cgi-bin dir:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
. /full/path/to/the/checkout/util/pcblib-param.cgi
</pre>
