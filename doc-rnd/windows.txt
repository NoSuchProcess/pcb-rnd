State on windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Does not work yet. This file documents how far we got. The situation
is constantly improving.

1. Cross compilation from Linux to win32
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(developers may need this, if you are an user, skip to 2.)

TODO: deps with mpk

Use mingw and wine:

	./configure --emu="wine cmd /c" --target=i586-mingw32msvc "$@"

(Replace i586- with whatever toolchain prefix you have)

2. download the binary pack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Temporary URL: http://igor2.repo.hu/tmp/pcb-rnd-pack.zip

Download, unpack, run setup.bat then pcb-rnd.bat

All binaries in the pack are cross-compiled from source, using mingw and
mpk. All binaries are 32-bit. The pack is self-contained, no gtk or other
external dependencies.

Known bugs:
	- inserting elements fail (even static ones)
	- no shell and awk in the pack -> parametric footprints fail
	- text (including menu text) doesn't appear on XP

Worked on systems:
	- Windows 8.1, Hungarian, 32 bit
	- Windows 7, Hungarian, 64 bit
	- Windows 7 pro, English, 64 bit
