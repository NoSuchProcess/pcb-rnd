pcb-rnd 3.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This milestone release makes the last step to librnd separation: pcb-rnd 
./configure now depends on librnd installed. 

Feature highlight:

1. New external dependency: librnd (>=3.0.0); this includes all HIDs.
   For more information about where to get it, how to install it
   (including no-root installation), please refer to the file called INSTALL.

2. Renames:
   - pcblib/ to footprint/
   - pcblib/tru-hole to footprint/thru-hole
   - config file from pcb-conf.lht to conf_core.lht (user config is affected)
   - new standard user footprint path: ~/.pcb-rnd/footprint; ~/pcblib is still
     on the default search path but users are encouraged to move the lib

2. Better specctra DSN support: io_dsn can load and save the whole board
   (at least copper and nets). Besides driving external autorouters, this
   may be used as a last-resort import path from proprietary CAD systems.

3. PADS write: boards can be written in the PADS ASCII format

4. Removed glib dependency from the puller plugin; this makes pcb-rnd
   free of glib. The only indirect way pcb-rnd could still depend on glib
   is through librnd when a GTK HID is loaded.
