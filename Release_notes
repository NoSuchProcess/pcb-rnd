pcb-rnd 1.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fifth phase of the large scale cleanup, featuring a full rewrite of the
configuration setting system: there's no separate settings, preferences,
color files, every runtime configuration is part of a structured,
orthogonal system. This introduces a few features, like per .pcb
color map, saving and restoring window layout per user or even per design.

Beside the conf rewrite, the new release features a lot of dead-code removal,
compiler warning cleanup and code simplification all over the place.

The build system and portability got some care too, pcb-rnd should compile
on Mac OS X out of the box. On Linux, pcb-rnd builds successfully with Motif
installed instead of lesstif. Build dependencies are relaxed: no m4,
no bison and no yacc required.

The library can be rescanned without restarting pcb-rnd.

The file format is moved into a plugin called io_pcb; alternative
native file format plugins are possible now.

There's no artificial restriction on the number of styles; styles
can be created on the fly. All styles are saved and loaded properly.
