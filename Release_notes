pcb-rnd 3.0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a minor feature release

Feature highlight:

1. Dependency on librnd bumped to 3.1.0; the generic half of the preferences
   window tabs are moved from pcb-rnd to librnd.

2. New board format to load: altium, protel 98/99

3. New export 3d formats: amf and projector

4. io_eagle can load footprints from eagle libs directly

5. export_xy: more template variables for generating different rotations

6. export_xy: optional subcircuit attributes for per-vendor (per-fab)
   rotation and translation so that a footprint lib can be adjusted
   to work with multiple p&p fabs with contradicting origin requirements
