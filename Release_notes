pcb-rnd 1.0.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.0.8 is the second phase of the large scale cleanup started at 1.0.7.

Major changes:

- more than 40% of the core code has been turned into plugins
  (see http://repo.hu/projects/pcb-rnd/mods)
- revive libstroke support (should work with the gtk HID)
- fix the remaining TODOs in back annotation, including action net(add,net,pin)
- revive the renumber code (was on hold because of the back annotation patch)
- clean up util/ (compiler warnings, indentation)
