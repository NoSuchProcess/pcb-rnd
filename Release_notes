pcb-rnd 1.1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main features of this release are kicad compatibility, the new
query/advanced-search, a bunch of mainline and old plugins imported and
that the lihata board format has reached production quality.

The lihata board format introduces a feature that is rare in this class
of applications: it can load and save board files preserving comments,
the original indentation, bracing style, units and even numerical
formats. This reduces unwanted diffs.

This is the last release before a major cleanup of internal data structures.
The lihata board format had to be sorted out so that new core features
can be saved and loaded without breaking the inflexible .pcb format. Since
the cleanup will break the remaining binary compatibility with mainline,
this was also the last moment we could import old plugins with reasonable
effort.
