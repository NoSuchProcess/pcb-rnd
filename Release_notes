pcb-rnd 1.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finally, the long postponed major core cleanup has been implemented. This
probably has been among the top 5 cleanups in the project history back to
the 90s.

First, the code is now reorganized to build up around object types
instead of actions. This means there's an obj_line.c, obj_arc.c, etc.
that know how to do everything with lines, arc, etc. The old code had
everything built around actions, so there was move.c, rotate.c, etc.,
that knew how to move, rotate, etc. all object types. The new
organization makes it much simpler to change how objects behave or to
introduce new objects.

The second part of the cleanup was to add pcb_ and PCB_ prefix to global
symbols in core API. This will allow us to split core into libs with
external, public API later, without risking name clashes. This will provide
better code reuse.

Among with the large cleanup, a lot of bugs have been found and fixed.
