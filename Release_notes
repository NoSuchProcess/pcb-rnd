pcb-rnd 1.2.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The focus of the release is pad stacks: a new, generic object type that
can serve as:
 - via
 - pin
 - pad
 - mounting hole

The second most important effort was fixing most of the remaining
subcircuit-related issues. By now subcircuits with padstacks or
with heavy terminals are production-quality alternatives to
elements/pins/pads.

The arbitrary shaped pad support and polygon-clear-in-polygon
features are upgraded with thermals. It is now possible to generate
a thermal relief for any SMD or through-hole pad:
 - round cap lines
 - square cap lines
 - circle
 - arc
 - arbitrary shaped convex polygon

The attribute dialog API got extended by a Dynamic Attribute Dialog (DAD) API;
all new dialog boxes are implemented using the DAD, which makes the same code
work with all existing HIDs. Already existing, per-HID dialog implementions
will be revised and converted to DAD wherever possible.

Plugin io_eagle is now mature enough to load complex boards drawn in
Eagle, using both the new xml format and the older binary format.
