pcb-rnd 3.0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a minor bugfix release with focus on fixing various bugs reported
(see the Changelog for details).

Other than the bugfixes, feature highlights are:

1. svg, ps, eps and png export plugins got a major code reorganization so
   that the generic (low level) parts could be copied to librnd to be reused
   in sch-rnd and camv-rnd later

2. the library dialog (including parametric editor dialog) and export dialog
   got generalized to be reused in sch-rnd
