pcb-rnd 1.2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We had multiple focuses in the past 2 months for producing pcb-rnd 1.2.2,
an important feature-rich release:

1. Going on with the major cleanup/split in the gtk HID allows pcb-rnd to
have multiple GTK based HIDs.

2. One of the new GTK based HID has opengl rendering (reusing the old code).

3. Font upgrade: support for multiple fonts on the same board, font
selectable per text object; arc in font; polygon in font.

4. More user friendly font editor: can load and save fonts directly from/to
files on the disk; can edit any of the currently loaded fonts; can edit
arcs and polygons.

5. Rubber band and signal routing UI improvements.

6. Support for EDAkrill in the library window.

7. More io_ support: tEDAx footprints and netlists, import netlist from
mentor graphics schematics, import KiCad's eeschema netlist.

8. gtk dialog box for editing parameters of parametric fooprints

9. Generic cleanup: start removing global PCB, making the layer code reentrant
