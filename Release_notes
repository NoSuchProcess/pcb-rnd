pcb-rnd 1.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This initial release already has some of the major features planned. The
new code is somewhat crude and a lot of cleanup is required on the original
code as well. New features include shaped pins, improved warnings for shorts,
internal connections of elements and nonetlist flag.
