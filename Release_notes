pcb-rnd 3.0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release introduces a major font engine refactoring (for reuse in other
Ringdove apps) and minor bugfixes (see the Changelog for details).

Feature highlights are:

1. plugin for importing netlist/schematics from sch-rnd

2. refactored font engine (reused in sch-rnd)

3. new font edit actions: FontXform(), FontSetXdelta(), FontNormalize()

4. switched over some exporters (png, svg, ps, lpr) to use librnd's
   implementation instead of the local; pcb-rnd now depends on
   librnd >= 3.2.0

5. plugin for ordering PCB fabbing directly from pcb-rnd; can remember
   settings in board attributes

6. PadstackReplace() action and menu item: mass-replaces the padstack
   prototype or selected padstacks, even within subcircuits

7. named all HPANE/VPANE widgets; from now on saving and restoring window
   geometry will also save/restore pane proportions

8. change in default file naming conventions: *.rp for boards, *.rf for
   footprints; old filenames also work, users are free to choose whatever
   name for new files despite of the new conventions.

9. new exporter: export_debug writes easy-to-process, computer-readable,
   line-oriented plain text

10. menu for saving first padstack from buffer; this makes padstack
    construction fully consistent with subcircuit construction
