pcb-rnd 2.1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release improves on the infrastructure (installable hidlib, gtk
internals simplified) and upgrades user scripting support. Beside
these main targets a lot of bugs got fixed and a several smaller features
got implemented.

Feature highlight:

1. scripting anywhere: AWK (fawk), BASIC (fbas) and Pascal (fpas) scripting
   using the libfawk minilib, without any external dependency

2. full buffer content save and load (in lihata)

3. a new option for saving all buffer subcircuits as a library

4. the mark (placed with {a m}) is not changed by pcb-rnd as side effect
   of drawing operations

5. converted pcblib (both static and parametric footprints) to lihata;
   new, global parameters: pad_mask_ratio pad_mask_offs, pad_mask_offs,
   pin_mask_offs, pad_mask_ratio, pin_mask_ratio

6. noexport attribute to inhibit objects from exporting with specific
   exporters or in general

7. first working windows cross-compiled version

8. export code tuning, menus and documentation for the new assy layers;
   document all the common doc layer types/purposes (including keepouts)
