pcb-rnd 1.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sixth phase of the large scale cleanup. Major features:
 - a semi-working windows version (testers needed)
 - resurrected the dbus plugin (testers needed)
 - proper route style handling with explicit "pen style" and a real working
   SetSame() action
 - various gtk bugs fixed
 - added the first working features in the Kicad legacy format I/O plugin
 - scconfig improvements:
  - no more config.manual.h, everything is detected by ./configure and the
    user should use command line arguments to change settings
  - only C89 is assumed
  - proper cross-compilation (tested in GNU/Linux -> Windows relation)
