pcb-rnd 2.3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main objective of this release is to go further in librnd separation:
the build system is prepared for the split, redundancies between pcb-rnd and
librnd are mostly removed. Other than this, 2.3.1 is mainly a bugfix release
with only a few new features.

Feature highlight:

1. Improved lock handling new hotkey {s k} for listing locked object.

2. New feature plugin for printing net name on traces when zoom level is
   high enough and the feature is enabled.

3. Many bugfixes in IO code for eagle and kicad for a more lossless
   load of alien board and footprint files.
