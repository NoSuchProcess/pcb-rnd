pcb-rnd 2.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main objective of this release is to go further in librnd separation:
by now, librnd is a single directory, imported from an external repository.
Furthermore this is also a feature release.

Feature highlight:

1. Padstack prototypes can be saved to file and loaded from file, using the
   board's or subcircuit's padstacks dialog. File format is the native
   lihata format.

2. Font support: with an optional plugin, ttf glyphs can be imported and
   converted to native font symbols, using actions or a dialog box.

3. ch_editpoint: optional (default enabled) highlight feature of object
   editpoints (e.g. line endpoints) on mouse hover.

4. Undo: made many actions undoable: text scale, ChangePinName(),
   ChangeNonetlist(), padstack hole changes, subc flags (including lock),
   attributes, RouteStyle(), creating and removing route styles, changing
   layer combining flags

5. New "manage plugins" dialog box with more details and more control over
   the plugins, including unloading plugins on the fly

6. Query: user functions and more builtin accessor/utility functions; most
   notably: a built-in function that can do advanced layer stackup queries
   and checks around an object.

7. Layer selector widget: all layer visible/invisible buttons and hotkeys
