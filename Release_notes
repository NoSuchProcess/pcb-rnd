pcb-rnd 3.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is mainly a bugfix release with a few minor features on external
autorouter and propedit/query/drc side.

Bugfix and feature highlight:

1. support for freerouting_cli and freerouting.net integration in
   ar_extern.

2. Xor-drawing of a padstack (while placing or moving) renders the hole/slot
   too. This makes it easier to position the object. In some cases it
   makes the object visible (hole-only padstack, e.g. mounting-hole).

3. The property editor and query() have access to thermal bits per layer ID
   via a new subtree padstack/thermal/lid/. This makes mass-editing thermals
   and scripting thermals easier.

4. DRC test for invalid character in text object.
