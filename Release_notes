pcb-rnd 2.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Focus of this release is infrastructural cleanups, bugfixes
and GUI rendering optimization. The new features added in this
release are all about extending the infrastructure to get the
flexibility of pcb-rnd to the next level.

New feature highlights:

1. Cam exporting interface: a simple, unified interface to tell
any exporter what layers to export to what file names.

2. Command line modes: the command line interpreter can be switched
to interpret syntax different from pcb actions.

3. Scripting support upgrade to using fungw (10 scripting languages,
including awk, python, perl, ruby, javascript, lisp). Support for
switching the command line into script mode using any of the
supported scripting languages (the user can enter script one-liners directly).

4. ddraft: angle/length constraint actions and GUI, trim() and split() actions,
a new command line mode with a syntax designed for 2d drafting. Similar
to those in mechanical cads, with actions to draw lines perpendicular or
parallel to existing lines.

5. Command line GUI upgrade: more seamless integration of command line
editing and mouse actions.

6. New, single-stage, non-modal export dialog with tabs available exporters
(also available in lesstif).

7. Import plugin: freepcb netlist - schematics from EasyEDA can be imported

8. Persistent layer color, saved with the board. Layer colors from the
configuration are used only as initial color for new layers.
