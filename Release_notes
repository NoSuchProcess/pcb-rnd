pcb-rnd 1.0.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.0.9 is the third phase of the large scale cleanup started at 1.0.7.

Major objective was to clean up memory management. As a first step
glib was replaced with a set of minilibs for core and util/. The only
modules still use glib are the gtk HID (gtk depends on glib anyway), the
puller (will be fixed later) and the toporouter (will be either fixed
or removed).

After the "unglib" project, a lot of effort went into fixing memory leaks and
potential buffer overruns in the code inherited from pcb originally.

The modularization effort progressed some more too: all exporter HIDs are
plugins now. A bunch of unused/old/obsolete core functions are moved to
a separate plugin so they don't need to be compiled into the executable.
The fontmode (font editor) became a plugin too. There are 23 plugins at
the moment, from which 15 used to be hardwired code in pcb core and 7
used to be compile-time selectable HIDs.

pcb-rnd plugins have 3-state configuration:
 - disable: do not compile at all 
 - buildin: compile and static link into the executable
 - plugin: compile into dynamic loadable plugin
