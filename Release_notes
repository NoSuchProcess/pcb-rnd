pcb-rnd 2.3.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is mainly a bugfix release with secondary objective of going further
in librnd separation: librnd is now linked with -l. NOTE: this changes how
pcb-rnd is executed from the source tree, see file INSTALL, step 3. Because
of the longer development cycle, there are still a few new features.

Feature highlight:

1. Optional feature: show (render) netnames on traces when zoomed in.
   View menu, show netnames when zoomed in. Config node:
   plugins/show_netnames/enable

2. Anyload files to ease sharing and importing user scripts, menu patches,
   drc rules, vendor drill, custom configuration and other pcb-rnd addons.

3. Lihata board save as: denoise option that omits select/warn/found flags
   and rat line objects from the save to reduce VCS noise.

4. Per layer transformations option: per layer wireframe render option on
   the GUI (right click context menu in the layer selector).

5. The propedit dialog has in-line help about which property means what
   (top right region of the dialog box).

6. Rewritten rendering code to get layer order from a configurable, domain
   specific render script instead of hardwired C.

7. Teardrop extended object.
