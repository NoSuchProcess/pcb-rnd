pcb-rnd 1.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.0.2 is a minor cleanup release. While cleaning up more autotools
leftover and switching over more parts to scconfig, it became possible
to configure the lesstif HID.

Both the gtk and the lesstif HIDs are optional (so that they can be
--disabled in ./configure and it is not fatal if they are not found).
Multiple GUI HIDs can be compiled into the same pcb-rnd executable.
When starting pcb-rnd, there is a builtin list of GUI HID preferences:
gtk, lesstif, <anything_else>. The user can explicitly set the preferred
GUI with the --gui option (e.g. pcb-rnd --gui lesstif).

The rest of the cleanup is about minor bugs in parametric footprints
and the footprint preview script.
