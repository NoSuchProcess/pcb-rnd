pcb-rnd 1.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a new peak in number of developers and contributors, version 1.2.1
introduces a large amount of bug fixes, cleanups and new features that
can be sorted in the following main groups.

1. Layer model rewrite; pcb-rnd now has a clear separation of physical
layer and logical layer concepts. There's new, board cross-section GUI
to visualize and manipulate the layer stack.

2. The hid_gtk refactoring; big, monolithic code blocks are split up in
smaller, more independent, lib-like modules and are moved to a lib plugin.
This paves the road for a modular setup to support multiple graphic
renderings and maybe even different gtk versions.

3. Automated testing and validation: a new infrastructure for automated
testing of exporters is added. The reference PNG files are manually validated
against the input PCB geometry - by now, we know exactly how much error
the PNG rendering has.

4. UI fixes: better rubber band, xor-outline-while-moving and DRC outline
visualization support.

5. Introducing the "EDA ecosystem" idea: real working import/export bridges
or flows to fidocadj, freerouting.net, ltspice, mucs and TinyCAD. Major
improvements in the KiCad file format compatibility.

6. The toporouter got removed in favor of the new routers for now.
