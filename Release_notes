pcb-rnd 1.2.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release switches over the whole code base to use the new data model
(padstacks, subcircuits) instead of the old, now obsolete model (vias,
pins, pads, elements). Conversion forth and back is done automatically,
on the fly, during load and save.

The local rtree implementation has been replaced with genrtree. This makes
it much easier to share the rtree code among projects, decreases the
maintenance burden. Unlike the local rtree implementation, genrtree
has unit tests.

The new rtree API features loop iterators, which allows the caller to
have much simpler and more readable code, without callback functions and
context structs.

The rest of the development focused on fixing bugs.
