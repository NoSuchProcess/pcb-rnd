pcb-rnd 1.0.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.0.10 is the fourth phase of the large scale cleanup started at 1.0.7. This
release focuses on getting on with modularization, replacing the resource
infrastructure and replacing the MenuEntry code for libraries.

In modularization, more code moved from core to plugins, including all
HIDs, shorthand comands and the report action. The whole footprint
listing and loading has been outsourced into a plugin, fp_fs. An
alternative footprint plugin, fp_wget implements gedasymbols.org
integration.

Resource files have been replaced with lihata files. This removes a
custom, domain-specific minilanguage from pcb code in favor of a more
generic, still small container format. As a side effect it is now
possible to use multi-key hotkeys in gtk and bind multiple hotkeys to
the same menu item. By the time the new version provided the same
functionality plus multikey in gtk, it was more than 300 lines smaller
than the original version.

The library code rewrite allows footprint libraries to be generic trees
of arbitrary depth (the original code allowed only 2 levels). This is
essential for displaying more complex library structuers (such
gedasymbols.org) but also helped cleaning up special cases from the
code.

Changing HIDs on the fly alreayd works partially: it's possible to switch
between gtk and lesstif once in a session. The limitation comes from
gtk's broken design and will be worked around in a later release.
