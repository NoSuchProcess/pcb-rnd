pcb-rnd 3.0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a minor bugfix release with focus on fixing various bugs reported
(see the Changelog for detaisl).

Other than the bugfixes, changeset highlights are:

1. 'auto place via' is now disabled by default; this means if you are drawing
   a trace with the line tool and switch layer, via is not automatically
   placed. Can be re-enabled from the preferences dialog config tree tab.

2. changing the thermal scale in the preferences dialog is now undoable

3. configurable mask/paste generation in the bga() footprint
