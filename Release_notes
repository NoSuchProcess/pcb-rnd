pcb-rnd 1.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two major changes for release 1.0.1:
 1. autotools replaced with scconfig
 2. rework of the footprint infrastructure

Other changes are minor bug fixes.

1. Scconfig

Autotools is big, slow, hard to maintain and often fails badly
on any non-mainstream system. Scconfig is small, simple, and fast.
It supports many systems. It may still fail on some exotic systems,
but at least it's much easier to fix it when it fails.

2. Footprint infrastructure rework

Pcb-rnd features new mini-library written in C that is responsible for
searching and loading footprints. Search is done on a simple search
path - a lot of heuristics based on base directories and library names
are removed in favor of the flat list of paths. Both pcb-rnd and
gsch2pcb-rnd uses the same code so their footprint search mechanism
always match.

Generated footprints are not m4-specific anymore. A lot of code has been
removed from both pcb-rnd and gsch2pcb-rnd. Now they both call external
programs using the shell to generate the footprint, without assuming they
are written in m4.

The syntax of generated footprints changed: if a footprint name
(footprint gschem attribute) contains parenthesis, it is to be generated,
else it's just the name of a file footprint.

New default footprint library shipped with pcb-rnd. Newlib/ and lib/
has been removed in favor of pcblib/, which is a minimalistic footprint
library containing essential footprints only. Most footprints are imported
from Newlib (geda/) and some from openhw on repo.hu.
